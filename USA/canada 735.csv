https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/sensing-dynamics, Noze ,Grant,Noze (formerly known as Stratuscent) is the global leader in digital smell detection. Using technology built on a foundation of NASA-patented innovations deployed on the International Space Station  Noze created the world’s first and only digital nose that can detect  identify  and interpret odors in everyday environments with incredible accuracy. This creates groundbreaking opportunities across multiple sectors and industries  where digital olfaction has high-value applications ranging from medical diagnostics and food manufacture & storage to public safety  air intelligence  and smart consumer electronics.Our platform is an end-to-end solution that combines a neural network-based AI engine with a cutting-edge digital olfaction sensor based on exclusive NASA patents. The sensor decodes the environment as a whole  isolating signal from background scent noise and creating a unique ‘scentprint’ for each individual chemical (VOC)  chemical mixture  or smell. The AI engine decodes data from the sensor to identify exactly what is in the air  in what quantity  and how it’s evolving. This continuous real-time analysis enables scent recognition in under a second with incredible accuracy. And each time the AI engine learns a new smell  every sensor in the world learns it too. Our APIs can be seamlessly integrated with new or existing user interfaces (UIs)  enabling real-time access to data  analytics  and alerts. Meanwhile  a secure and encrypted communication protocol protects all the data flows within our platform and its ecosystem., Artificial Intelligence  Cloud Computing  Consumer Electronics  Internet of Things  Machine Learning  Sensor, Montréal  Quebec  Canada,Noze is a digital smell detection company that specializes in detecting  identifying  and interpreting odors in everyday environments,6 772,2015,Active,—, — , — ,—,—,For Profit, www.noze.ca ,https://www.facebook.com/noze.labs,https://www.linkedin.com/company/noze-ai,https://twitter.com/noze_ai,hello@noze.ca,833-247-3673,12, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Consumer Electronics  Data and Analytics  Hardware  Internet Services  Science and Engineering  Software,2, Ashok Prabhu Masilamani  Kais Gadhoumi,11-50,10,Early Stage Venture,Mar 14  2023,$1 000 000,CA$13 200 000,Series A,$15 824 010,$17 790 418, Creative Destruction Lab (CDL)  Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  Investissement Quebec  Mistral Venture Partners  TandemLaunch,4,8,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,15, — ,—,—,—,—,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,Testing,2,7,9,—,2,20,51,—,182,-96.37%,73.33%,4,-14.29%,0%,—,8 413 525,4 077 138,94.02%, Engineering  Management  Product,14,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,6 787,—,5.8,6.4,6

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/sam, Samdesk ,Series A,SAM turns unstructured social media into actionable insight and awareness. It also operates a social media management platform for newsrooms. The company allows newsrooms to curate  collaborate  search  annotate  verify  and process around social content  as well as publish and tell stories with social content.When the unexpected occurs  every second count - millions of dollars are often lost in just the first few minutes after an emergency. Having accurate and relevant data on the location and impact of an emergency event as it unfolds is of paramount importance to those in corporate security  public safety  and emergency response. However  obtaining this information using traditional news media and data analysts is expensive  slow  and prone to error. SAM Inc. has developed a novel tool which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the location of emergency events based on social media chatter. Their proprietary algorithm scans millions of social media posts to detect events such as fire  flooding  tornado  or terrorist attacks  at their earliest stages based on unstructured social media chatter. Following the detection of an event  we use AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to verify the source and triangulate location. This information is then provided to decision-makers so they can take appropriate action quickly and monitor the situation as it unfolds in time and space  minimizing the impact on business operations and risk to personnel. When the unexpected happens  every second counts and SAM provides minutes.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/insig, Insig ,Corporate Round,In early 2015  we realized that there was a wealth of medical knowledge online but no intelligent interpretation or curation of it. We aimed to solve this by creating an Artificial Intelligence engine that could bring a patient to diagnosis based on their current medical state  symptoms and past medical history. In our pursuit we analyzed over 3 million patient records in engineering an AI model that could lead a naive patient right to diagnosis through simple questioning.Our algorithm became quite robust and reached nearly 80% accuracy. As we continued our research  meeting with more and more doctors  we found that the most immediately impactful application of our AI would come in automating medical documentation and administrative tasks slowing down practitioners.We decided to expand our focus from simply to diagnosis  to automating processes across the medical clinic. In everything we do  our goal is to help practitioners get back to what they do best ... medicine! Insig takes care of the rest!Why Remote Data Capture?Collecting patient information is absolutely critical in providing quality healthcare. Our intelligent questionnaire system automates the rendering of medical notes  the collection and organization of medical history  and rendering of any original paperwork/forms.Why Virtual Care?For some cases in medicine (i.e sick notes) there is little reason for a patient to come in.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/talem-health-analytics, Talem AI ,Seed,Talem is an artificial intelligence company focusing on crash  injury  and billing analysis within auto claims. The core mission is the development of novel  value-add solutions for insurers surrounding the prediction  treatment  payment  and adjudication of claims involving bodily injuries. We are relentlessly focused on bringing innovation to the bodily injury arena in a fashion similar to those who have brought innovations to address damage to the vehicle before us.The foundation of the Talem platform was built to analyze photos of vehicles post-accident and deliver predictions related to the impact  forces  and damage to the human body – rather than the vehicle. This foundation and additional feature set are specifically designed to materially impact key areas of the claim lifecycle through a data-driven focus on injury causation and the recovery of an injured party. What we have learned throughout our journey is that insurers do not have a solid grasp of injuries until late in the claim lifecycle. This reactive approach to bodily injury management opens opportunities for the increased claim and operational costs  a growing number of open claims  and a higher likelihood of undetected fraud. Talem's approach provides a fundamental shift to earlier  more proactive management and data-driven insights which has proven to be successful. We have demonstrated up to a 90% reduction of service referral time  50% reduction of adjuster handle time for medical bill processes  greater than 500k annual handle time savings  and an indication of 50% savings on services with a Talem subscription vs traditional transactional approach. To execute on our vision we have assembled a team of experts in injury science  technology  and insurance operations. Our team members have  on average  twenty years of experience in the management of automotive injuries  medical claims management  end-to-end insurance services and operations  occupant kinematics  injury causation and rehabilitation  and highly sophisticated data & analytics tools and methods.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/imerciv, iMerciv ,Grant,iMerciv is a Toronto based start-up leveraging crowdsourcing and AI to empower pedestrians with personalized navigation and actionable data in real time for safe  convenient and accessible trips. With the help of fellow pedestrians  always know what’s happening on your sidewalks and get the best routes for you  with our new pedestrian navigation app: MapinHood. Think Waze for Walkers.Navigation was never built for pedestrians. Existing navigation apps are run on routing engines that have been built and optimized for vehicular travel and don’t consider all the variables that can affect pedestrian travel. People are not cars so why should we navigate like them? MapinHood runs on iMerciv's custom AI routing engine that is built for the flexibility of pedestrian travel  resulting in the most personalized and inclusive navigation experience. For example  MapinHood can generate a user the safest path home at night based on lighting  crime and accident data. Or provide the most accessible route to a user in a wheelchair using gradient and accessibility relevant data. Our team has bootstrapped MapinHood with revenues from a previous product and were awarded Microsoft’s AI for Accessibility grant to help with the development. The company also recently made the cut for this year’s Next AI cohort – A Next Canada accelerator program.  The beta version of the MapinHood app was recently released on the Canadian app stores and is available to download on both Android or IOS. In light of the COVID-19 Pandemic  we have also just released new updates on MapinHood that help the public practice safe physical distancing via an ‘avoid crowds’ setting in the app  with more features coming that can help with estimating wait times at retailers and empowering vulnerable communities., Artificial Intelligence  Assistive Technology  Consumer Electronics  Crowdsourcing  Information Technology  Mapping Services  Mobile Apps  Navigation  Real Time  Wearables, Toronto  Ontario  Canada,iMerciv leverages crowd sourcing and AI to empower pedestrians with personalized navigation and actionable data in real time.,101 603,Aug 14  2014,Active,—, — , Great Lakes,—,—,For Profit, www.imerciv.com/ ,https://www.facebook.com/imerciv/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/imerciv-inc-,https://twitter.com/imerciv,info@imerciv.com,+1 (647) 919‑6565,12, —,—,—, —, —, Apps  Artificial Intelligence  Consumer Electronics  Data and Analytics  Hardware  Health Care  Information Technology  Mobile  Navigation and Mapping  Other  Science and Engineering  Software,2, Arjun Mali  Bin Liu,11-50,3,Seed,Oct 17  2019,$250 000,—,Seed,—,$350 000, TELUS  Microsoft  Ontario Centres of Excellence,—,3,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,9, — ,—,—,—,—,—,Testing,0,1,—,—,14,16,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, Management  Operations,2,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,102 718,—,0.7,-0.1,3.6

Our customers are public  governmental  academic and private healthcare organizations  pharma  HTAs  pharma consulting companies  3rd party payers and private consultants.Our startup is based on scientific cooperation of experts from McMaster university (Hamilton  ON  Canada) and a group of IT experts from Krakow  Poland.GRADEpro - our product for authoring of medical guidelines  with its over 100.000 users worldwide became a de-facto world-wide standard for health care guideline development.Our newest product - Laser AI solves the problem of the cost and time of creating literature reviews in health care and - based on them - healthcare/medical guidelines.The most impactful medical literature reviews - Systematic Reviews (SRs) are in fact Sisyphean reviews - it takes 1-2 years to produce a single SR and within two years of publication 23 percent of SRs will contain conclusions inconsistent with the new medical knowledge and the problem grows each month  because the speed of generation of new knowledge increased quasi-exponentially  and human abilities to process that information grow sub-linear.Laser AI speeds the process of evidence synthesis  data extraction and recommendation authoring by an order of 2 right now and will speed it up tenfold within next two years  due to highly specialized AI  based on an award-winning deep learning model which won the first prize in 2018 NIST TAC-SRIE competition., Artificial Intelligence  Health Care  Information Technology  Knowledge Management  Natural Language Processing, Hamilton  Ontario  Canada,AI-based tools and services for Evidence-Based Health Care,103 370,Apr 17  2014,Active,—, — , Great Lakes,—,—,For Profit, www.evidenceprime.com ,http://www.facebook.com/evidenceprime,http://www.linkedin.com/company/evidence-prime,http://twitter.com/evidence_prime,info@evidenceprime.com,1(905) 581-0214,5, —,—,—, —, —, Administrative Services  Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Health Care  Information Technology  Other  Science and Engineering  Software,2, Artur Nowak  Pawel Kunstman,11-50,1,Seed,May 1  2019,$2 000 000,$2 000 000,Seed,$2 000 000,$2 000 000, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,8, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,14,—,—,68,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, Engineering  Operations,2,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,104 518,—,-0.1,-0.6,-0.4

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/terrene, Terrene ,Pre-Seed,"Companies across all industries are struggling with integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning in their products and workflows. Currently  their only viable option of doing that is building it in-house with open-source software and lots of custom code. On average  companies have to devote a dedicated engineering team to six months of development time to collect  connect  and model their data. Even after the initial launch  a two-person team is required to maintain and extend the project; a fairly serious commitment.Apart from extremely rare cases  none of them needs to be doing that since most of their needs are the same  however  they keep building the same system over and over again simply because there’s no other alternative.Terrene cuts down the initial setup time from 6 months to less than 5 minutes and requires no maintenance. We will automatically pick the most important features from the connected data set and train a model around it.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/applied-brain-research, Applied Brain Research ,—,Applied Brain Research Inc is the maker of Nengo  a neuromorphic artificial intelligence interactive development environment for building neural computing applications. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging computing architecture which uses artificial neurons to compute like the brain does  massively parallel and low-power. AI networks built on neuromorphic hardware and software compute with less power and use more continuous states as opposed to discrete weight updates as machine learning algorithms do. The benefit is that applications built this way can use less power  be more responsive and more accurate. The neuromorphic architecture allows real-time integration of multiple AI networks into integrated  large  functional systems. Full-loop AI systems can be built with Nengo such as Spaun  the world's largest functional brain simulation. Spaun is ABR's research platform for full-loop service robotics. ABR is first commercializing Nengo as the compiler and runtime for the new generation of neuromorphic chips such as the Intel Loihi  Spinnaker and BrainDrop  as well as ABR's library of neuromorphic applications for these chips such as Reach for robotic reaching   Vision  Speech built on ABR's neuromorphic AI algorithms (spiking deep learning  reinforcement learning  adaptive control  ....). ABR's long run goal is to build its neuromorphic platform into a truly functional service robotic operating system  starting with ABR Reach and guided by the learnings from ABR's research into Spaun. ABR was spun out of Dr Chis Eliasmith's lab at the Center for Computation and Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo., Artificial Intelligence  Intelligent Systems  Machine Learning  Neuroscience  Semiconductor, Waterloo  Ontario  Canada,ABR makes the world's smallest edge AI chip for time-series processing and the world's most advanced neuromoprhic compiler.,148 720,Sep 10  2014,Active,—, — , Great Lakes,—,—,For Profit, www.appliedbrainresearch.com ,—,https://www.linkedin.com/company/applied-brain-research/,https://twitter.com/abr_inc,peter.suma@appliedbrainresearch.com,(416) 505-8973,11, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Biotechnology  Data and Analytics  Hardware  Science and Engineering  Software,7, Chris Eliasmith  Daniel Rasmussen  Peter Suma  Terry Stewart  Travis DeWolf  Trevor Bekolay  Xuan Choo,11-50,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Sep 11  2023,—,5, — ,—,—,—,—,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,Computing; Calculating,1,18,—,—,—,31,1 808,2 163.67,2 267,-4.44%,1 485.31%,2.85,3.17%,61.06%,55.92%,4 200 357,401 908,10.58%, Engineering  Management  Medical & Science  Operations,11,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,150 942,—,0.1,1.9,2

Our monitoring system provides maintenance staff with a workflow dashboard that prioritizes interventions and feeds the 'right info at the right time’ to the operator. We automatically inform lease operators or pumpers of issues in order to reduce site visits and allow management by exception.The solution consists of a hardware package that provides visual access to the wellhead  sensors tracking key operating parameters  and analytics software that processes and filters this info  then alerts the operator to certain conditions.The combination of these features and abilities allows a significant reduction in human cost of operation as well as operational risks. The package is designed to be self powered and extremely simple to install and use  which eliminates the need for an electrician and operational shut down during package installation.

Densyfy's AI driven technology analyzes the movie  removes the fluff  and creates a Densyfy'd version.  The technology does not modify the original film and uses cue points in the film to allow the film to be Densyfy’d on the fly. On-the-fly changes can be made to account for unexpected interruptions while you are watching which automatically Denyfys the film to ensure you watch the whole film.  Other scenarios exist in sporting events  catching up on TV shows  news  and so much more.""During our analysis data showed us that 90% of viewers watch 10% of the available content  which has provided a problem for content creators and distributors. Viewership has been on the decline due to the length of unimportant content continually increasing the length of time to complete the event. (ex: a Major League Baseball game ran an average of 3hrs 5min  but only 37min of this was determined to be essential content).

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/ova-2, OVA ,Pre-Seed,Most of the mixed reality (XR) content that exists today has been developed by teams of highly talented and technical individuals with experience using professional 3D engine or with a background in programming. The steep learning curve and difficulty of building XR has limited the amount of available content.StellarX powered by OVA is the best sandbox available for non-programmers to develop their own XR environments  and it enables them to build through simple drag-and-drop creation. Just like Minecraft enabled 70 million people to become 3D content creators  we think that there will be hundreds of millions of computer content creators and XR makes this incredibly accessible to people. Actually  StellarX is the path to fully accessible XR content creation for enterprise. Nowadays  the trend of more accessible tools continues  as does the amount of 3D data we are collecting. StellarX is making it easier than ever to leverage these assets. At OVA we have built over the past eight years a world-class sandbox that helps 3D content creators to build easily virtual worlds. Further pushing this trend is the growth of mixed reality where 3D is a necessity. As we increasingly spend time in the digital world  our digital “stuff” will rival the importance of our physical “stuff”. Amazon is the destination for physical goods  but the destination for digital goods represents a substantial opportunity. This is why we think it's crucial to democratize the 3D content creation. Creating a mixed reality environment is a creative process that includes a lot of challenging steps including defining the interaction and logic  building the world with assets and animations  adding some avatars and  finally  testing the virtual world with real users. Moreover  at OVA we believe that machine learning can be used across the entire creation process. We are building the best artificial intelligence that works together with our sandbox users. It can co-create with them in the process of building virtual worlds  help creative problem solving by suggesting ideas and can take out all the non-creative work so our users can work on what’s important., Artificial Intelligence  Augmented Reality  Machine Learning  Virtual Reality, Quebec  Quebec  Canada,OVA's StellarX is the ultimate metaverse content creation tool for non-pro-users.
