We are building an augmented analytics platform to provide actionable insights regarding online narratives. Our “Cyborg” intelligence methodology detects narratives and fine-grained emotional content  combining the power of human-in-the-loop learning with the latest in natural language processing  computational linguistics  and machine learning.The first use case centers on US electoral politics  specifically the 2020 race for President of the United States. Target customers are political campaigns  journalists  academics  and concerned citizens.  We are particularly focused on how messaging spreads among and between diverse online media  both negatively (propaganda) and positively (truth-based messages); which narratives persist over time; and the impact they have on overall discourse about a topic. Our StoryArc platform has been used to discover and quantify political bias  asymmetries in coverage of male vs. female candidates  and active misinformation campaigns.The second use case focuses more broadly on Misinformation Security and Responses. In collaboration with the Credibility Coalition  we are developing a standard framework to define the equivalent of the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Misinfosec. As a practical application of the framework  we address a broad spectrum of areas such as US immigration; health policy and impact; and climate change.
