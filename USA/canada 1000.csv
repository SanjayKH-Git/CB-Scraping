Segmentations provide quantitative metrics and help plan for surgeries by viewing 3D models  or 3D printing structures.

Build your machine learning pipeline with the right abstractions to both ease research  development  and deployment of your ML applications.____________________________________________From defining the problem to implementing the key solution  multiple special steps are to be considered when working with machine learning pipelines. Assuming you already have the data  Neuraxio can assist you in creating a good model (e.g.: a deep neural network) to do predictions on the data.Depending on the amount of data you have  the best model to use may change. If the amount of data you have comes to change  it could mean you need to do many solutions. Automatic Machine Learning could be useful in this case.In the context of Research and Development (R&D) projects  it's not uncommon to create and evaluate multiple different prototypes  following the scientific method. Good news: it's possible to automatically combine many machine learning models such that the resulting predictions are better  which makes the R&D process even more interesting from a business point of view.Learn more by visiting our website., Artificial Intelligence  B2B  Business Intelligence  Consulting  Intelligent Systems  Natural Language Processing  Predictive Analytics  Productivity Tools  Software  Software Engineering, Quebec  Quebec  Canada,Deep Learning  Machine Learning,579 649,May 18  2018,Active,—, — , — ,—,—,For Profit, www.neuraxio.com/ ,https://www.facebook.com/Neuraxio/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuraxio/,https://twitter.com/Neuraxio_Inc,info@neuraxio.com,418-262-7912,1, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Other  Professional Services  Science and Engineering  Software,1, Guillaume Chevalier,1-10,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,2,—,—,27, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,78,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,596 573,—,-0.3,0,0
