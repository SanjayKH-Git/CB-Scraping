https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/trials-ai, Trials.ai ,Venture - Series Unknown,The Trials.ai Smart Protocol system leverages artificial intelligence to efficiently navigate research teams in designing clinical trials that enable pharma  biotech and device companies to get treatments to patients faster.Trial sponsors spend $65B every year on clinical trials and 45% of those trials fail because they are poorly designed. These failures equate to billions of dollars in lost opportunity for trial sponsors every year - but more importantly  patients don't have time to wait for us to get it right. In the digital age  humans cannot physically read and digest every bit of information relevant to a given decision. In addition  almost every organization has what is called 'dark' or 'siloed' data – valuable data that is not being used  or that organizations don’t know they have at their disposal. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the data within a given organization is dark or siloed. As a result  pharmaceutical companies are making important decisions with incomplete information. ENTER TRIALS.AI - we are on a mission to get effective treatments to patients faster by using artificial intelligence to optimize clinical trial designs for speed and success. Unlike the current service models out there  we use smart technology to harness vast amounts of data that no human can process – then offer unique insights across therapeutic areas to trial sponsors. Using our codified clinical trials database  we are able to unlock information  derive insights and make recommendations to trial sponsors on how to best design & optimize their trial protocols.Based in San Diego  California  Trials.ai launched by Kim Walpole in 2016., Analytics  Artificial Intelligence  Clinical Trials  Machine Learning  Software, San Diego  California  United States,We are on a mission to get effective treatments to patients faster by using AI to optimize clinical trial protocols for speed and success.,37 884,Jul 2016,Active,$1M to $10M, Women Founded  Women Led, Greater San Diego Area  West Coast  Western US,Feb 6  2023,—,For Profit, trials.ai/ ,https://www.facebook.com/trialsai/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trials.ai,https://twitter.com/trialsAI,info@trials.ai,+15183149413,4, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Health Care  Science and Engineering  Software,2, Kim Walpole  Michael Nicoletti,1-10,6,M&A,Dec 21  2020,—,—,Venture - Series Unknown,$1 300 000,$1 300 000, Amplify.LA  Tech Coast Angels  Sway Ventures  Harmonix Fund  EvoNexus,2,11,—, Was Acquired,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,7, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,0,1,15,—,—,35,186,—,26,—,—,1.67,—,33.33%,—,7 774 140,—,—, Engineering  Management  Operations  Product  Sales,3,—, Trials.ai acquired by ZS Associates , ZS Associates ,Feb 6  2023,—,Acquisition,—,38 097,—,0,2.2,2.9

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/simplemachines-inc, SimpleMachines ,Series A,SimpleMachines (SMI) has created a Software-Defined Compute platform that is future-proofed against the growing needs of artificial intelligence  virtual reality  machine learning  robotics  and big data. Traditional computer systems (CPUs) were designed to be easily programmable  which allowed technology to permeate every facet of daily life. But the software those systems ran only got faster as a result of the doubling of performance every 2 years (Moore’s Law)  which has recently come to an end. Software has gotten more complex and data sets are growing exponentially  creating the need for a new chip platform. Recently  the industry has resorted to building single purpose systems (ASICs) that are impossible to reprogram. These hardware-only (chip) solutions are incredibly expensive  take years to develop and deploy (3+ years)  and run the risk of being obsolete by the time they are ready  making them poor investments for the rapidly changing software and environments they are meant to enable. SimpleMachines’s solution is a radically new software-centric approach to the problem that deploys a programmable platform with a breakthrough software stack that enables the programmer to easily optimize the hardware on the fly and get the performance of custom silicon with a platform that supports hundreds of different use cases., Artificial Intelligence  Machine Learning  Semiconductor, San Jose  California  United States,SimpleMachines has created a Software-Defined Compute Platform that is future-proofed for AI  ML VR  robotics  and big data.,40 106,2016,Active,$1M to $10M, — , San Francisco Bay Area  Silicon Valley  West Coast,—,—,For Profit, www.simplemachines.ai ,—,https://www.linkedin.com/company/simplemachines-inc/,—,info@simplemachinesinc.com,—,1, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Hardware  Science and Engineering  Software,1, Karu Sankaralingam,51-100,2,Early Stage Venture,Oct 31  2018,$16 700 000,$16 700 000,Series A,$19 600 000,$19 600 000, Alumni Ventures  Baidu Ventures  Wisconsin Investment Partners  IMO Ventures  Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,2,6,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,4, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,14,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, Information Technology  Operations,2,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,40 338,—,0,-0.1,-0.1

Machine learning is used to immediately and accurately identify compromised credentials and database attacks. Customers gain insights and a situational awareness of IT infrastructure including four primary benefits:    * Non-intrusively and continuously discovering all databases    * Deep analysis into database activity    * Pinpoint insider threats    * Artificial intelligence identifies insider threatsDB Networks continuous database infrastructure monitoring ""shines a light"" on what's really going on in your infrastructure. For example  undocumented and unmanaged databases may contain highly sensitive information and offer cyber attackers an enormously large attack surface. DB Networks non-intrusively discovers all databases and the interactions of users and applications to their connected databases. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) operating inside the core network introduce new  or alter user/application interactions. DB Networks maps all of these application interactions to rapidly identify APTs. Continuous monitoring the core network also identifies policy violations such as restricted databases being exposed to unrestricted network segments.DB Networks’ unique approach to intelligent database security utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to automatically create models of each applications proper interactions with their connected databases. These models are used to immediately and accurately identify database attacks.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/faceter, Faceter ,Initial Coin Offering,"Faceter is a video surveillance and security platform based on artificial vision technology and an approach that involves analyzing the chain of events happening in the frame and responding to them. We call it ""the event-based security model"".Most of the video surveillance software products currently available on the market operate in two categories: time of recording and source. This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras.Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers  family members  restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when  in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/lodestar-ae84, Lodestar ,—,With Lodestar you can annotate video far faster than with any other available tools. Lodestar lets you drag and drop hours of video and start annotating right away. It continuously trains a custom AI as you label. The AI automatically predicts labels  greatly speeding up the work. As the AI gets more accurate  so do the labels  so the annotation team can generate more labels faster than ever.The custom AI also drives our active learning system that automatically finds objects buried in hours of video and queues up the frames for the team to check. It adds the most helpful frames to the top of the queue  so the dataset gains the most valuable data first  and the model gets better faster.Finally  integrated dataset management and data science tools allow data scientists to run experiments and validate the dataset by training inference models in parallel with the labeling effort. No wasted time and money creating labels that aren't adding value to the dataset.Today  training a computer vision model can take months of multiple cycles of labeling  exporting  training a model  analyzing the results  and starting again to achieve success.Lodestar changes all that. Our advanced platform for labeling and training with native video support trains a model in real time and allows your teams to work in parallel.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/coral-7ef4, Coral ,—,Coral is a human-centric robotics company  designing robots for people to enhance their everyday lives. We believe that purpose-driven robots empower all people to achieve more.Robots have always been one of the greatest dreams and fears of people. We marvel at their capabilities  yet are terrified of what they can become. We want them to be intelligent  yet are constantly disappointed. We saw this paradox and thought what can we do differently?Using our backgrounds in engineering and design  we saw that we can use a thoughtful and people-first approach to making robots. Robots should work with people rather than do things only on their own. This relationship between person and robot should be one that’s constructive.When we were looking at where to call Coral home  it was important to us that it be a place filled with creativity  energy  and next to the ocean. We wanted to be in a place where we can foster talent and spark innovation. We wanted to be in a place where we can be reminded of the values of our brand. More importantly  we wanted to build a community of people who use design and robotics to empower people. That’s why Los Angeles is our home.We think robotics is an innovative and exciting space. We see a future with an ecosystem of robots that work together to help people in their daily lives. It’s important for us that we need to use thoughtful design to help get us to that future now., Apps  Artificial Intelligence  Consumer Electronics  Electronics  Product Design  Robotics  UX Design, Los Angeles  California  United States,Coral is a human-centric robotics company  designing robots for people to enhance their everyday lives.,287 409,2018,Active,$10M to $50M, — , Greater Los Angeles Area  West Coast  Western US,—,—,For Profit, coralrobots.com/ ,https://www.facebook.com/coralrobots/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/coralrobots/,https://twitter.com/coralrobots,info@coralrobots.com,—,8, —,—,—, —, —, Apps  Artificial Intelligence  Consumer Electronics  Data and Analytics  Design  Hardware  Science and Engineering  Software,2, George Ko  Ted Ko,1-10,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,5, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,10,15,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,295 156,—,0,1.7,4.3

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/viridischem, ViridisChem ,—,ViridisChem is a software company that has built the world’s largest toxicity database  and is developing SaaS  AI platform for toxicity evaluation of products and ingredients. Increasingly strict global regulations  litigation risks  and industry-wide push for cost reduction has created an urgent need for toxicity evaluations of not just the end-products  but also the starting materials. By screening out toxic drug targets  avoiding the use of toxic raw material  pharma and biochem companies can avoid many months of wasted R&D time  minimize the toxic waste generation  and avoid costly late-stage manufacturing changes. End result: less time and money needed to bring drug to market.For consumer sectors  by minimizing the use of toxic raw materials and formulations  they can minimize the risk of late-stage manufacturing changes  and increase govt. compliance  and brand recognition.What do we offer?:1)	Toxicity of less than 0.1% of chemicals is known. Scientists rely on material data-sheets  but 80% of these are either inaccurate or incomplete. We offer toxicity evaluation of all chemicals  including new molecules2)	Companies are having difficulty in keeping track of worldwide frequently changing government regulations and chemical threshold. We provide up-to-date compliance and chemical threshold information3)	Within consumer industries  suppliers don’t disclose formulation ingredients (their IP)  and they cannot accurately predict toxicity of their formulations  because the models that take into account the % composition of chemicals  and their interactions within mixtures don’t exist.  We are building such models using machine-learning algorithms ensuring increasing accuracy. By offering accurate toxicity related information throughout R&D  ViridisChem will lead the standardization of toxicity evaluation across all industriesOur Solution:We have built the most comprehensive toxicity database with over 90 million chemicals and 2.4 billion properties  curated using AI techniques  and are offering through yearly subscription  an AI powered SaaS software platform that provides toxicity evaluation (related to ecological  health and safety) of any chemical  even the new molecules  identifies local  regional  and per country regulatory issues and established thresholds related to the chemical use  allowing scientists to eliminate high-risk drug candidates.

How do we do this?Our solution’s ability to query patient information  significantly faster and much more accurate than any front-end API  will help physicians reduce the time spent looking at a computer screen.  We do the hard work on the back-end  so physicians can do the critical work on the front-end; providing a high efficacy driven & personalized care approach.

We do this by significantly reducing the time spent on EHR chart review  which also helps to reduce physician burnout. The ability to transform existing health care data into the new standard (FHIR)  will spark innovation and yield better patient outcomes.  Our technology is strategically built to implement and comply with the standards set forth by Health level 7    FHIR v4.0.1  and the US Core Implementation Guide v3.1.0.We understand FHIR guidelines will continue to improve as we collectively journey on this endeavor.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/coursa-retail, Coursa Retail ,—,Coursa Retail: Achieving parity between online and offline shopper behavior data. High-accuracy in-store shopper path and behavior insights with no store infrastructure.What if there was a new  innovative approach to track in-store shopper behavior that delivers consistent in-aisle shopper position accuracy to 1.5 meters and addresses the scalability challenge by eliminating the need for any in-store systems or technology? Solving both of these challenges (accuracy and scalability) is possible today using motion sensing technology that is already available in most shopper smartphones. Accuracy and scalability are the driving factors behind the creation of Coursa RetailCoursa Retail helps retailers  brands and digital ad platforms to accurately measure or execute the following:Improved offline attribution: When a shopper views a digital mobile ad on their smartphone  does it lead to the shopper visiting the shelf in-store where that product is located.	In-store missed conversions: Measure all product categories that a shopper visits in-store. Highlight which category visits do not lead to a purchase (missed conversions).
