https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/fabrica-ai, Fabrica AI ,Seed,Fabrica AI is creating a future where ideating and developing a robot for any task takes days  not years. We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs  we can automate the whole development process. At the current stage  the most important resource is a large fleet of robots to validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data. This would help keep us grounded in reality. To start building up the fleet  we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by 5x and are piloting it on construction sites in Singapore managed by Woh Hup  BHCC  Gin Chia  Soilbuild  and Dragages. We have early leads in the US and Europe as well. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. Grouting is part of virtually every construction project and a highly laborious process  is considered one of the most physically damaging tasks resulting in tilers’ knees and back issues  and thus quality issues would also arise.  We invented a patent pending robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. The operators would only need to reload grout and water.We are headquartered in Delaware  and have offices in Singapore and Brno  Czech Republic. Demo locations include Zurich  Miami  London/Cambridge  and Vienna., Artificial Intelligence  Construction  Robotics, Singapore  Central Region  Singapore,Fabrica AI is creating a future where ideating and developing a robot for any task takes days  not years.,38 529,2022,Active,—, — , Asia-Pacific (APAC)  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Southeast Asia,—,—,For Profit, www.fabrica.ai/ ,—,https://www.linkedin.com/company/fabrica-ai,—,Contact@fabrica.ai,+65 98237808,—, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Hardware  Real Estate  Science and Engineering  Software,3, Jakub Suchanek  Keefe Wayne Teo  Ronald Luc,11-50,2,Seed,Mar 27  2023,$850 000,$850 000,Seed,$1 180 000,$1 180 000, Hoxton Ventures,1,1,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,9, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,14,1 181,—,879,—,—,3.1,—,57.92%,—,4 818 569,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,38 745,—,0,0.9,-0.1

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/keyreply, KeyReply ,Seed,KeyReply is an enterprise conversation AI platform with knowledge management and patient engagement automation capabilities. It offers specialized workflows for patient servicing and medical protocol information access.     It provides patients and clinicians with appropriate answers by creating contextually relevant information derived from content across the organization.     Unlike manual customer support or a small number of subject matter experts who are expensive  inconsistent to sale and has a long lead time to hire and train  especially in a specialized and high stakes domain like healthcare.        KeyReply works best for hospitals who need to provide responses to patients and multiple stakeholders from multiple-segmented teams. Hospitals can reduce response times and improve response rates with less skilled staff in a high turnover environment while improving patient satisfaction.     Hospitals also need accurate and up to date information to be given in an efficient and mass personalized manner.    Text analytics will also enable management to collect strategic feedback and understand what patients are concerned about.        As a result  KeyReply enables end to end transactions and cross-domain queries  which enables customer service turnaround time to be improved by 95% and speed up information retrieval by more than 3x.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/aigatha, AIgatha ,Seed,There are phrases of how we integrate our core technologies: LUCA - BlockchainFeatures of LUCA Architecture1. Separating token transactions and computing by connecting the public chain and the private chain;2. More added values by allowing miners to maintain ledger and realize project computing.As ETH is a sophisticated blockchain supported by numerous miners  we choose ETH smart contract as transaction medium for AIgatha token. It can also avoid transaction congestion due to shortage of miners at the early phase of AIgatha.Pangu - Distributed computing systemIn this phase  we will implement DC system on the blockchain. Features of Pangu Architecture:1. The cost of the computing power engaged in the jobs depends the amount of payment. Every task released in the Primordial Soup will be involved with more than two miners.2. More than 2 miners will be assigned to one task so as to increase the return rate; their results will be verified with each other in order to ensure the accuracy of the results simply.3. Blockchain make the status of these tasks become open and transparent. Information includes the miners responsible for computing  the computing duration and so on. By doing so  some existing problems in the DC products such as black-box operation will be addressed.4. Task assignment mechanism is designed to make cloud computing safer by eliminating the possibility that miners cannot assemble the whole picture of one job in spite that they are computing many tasks in one job.5. Mist computing will reduce the dependence in the cloud computing.6. Whitelist mechanism only allows users with ID verfication to use the system so as to aviod malicious use.7. Simple and intuitive-to-use interface and DC API allow users to quickly master the system to solve all kinds of problems.This phase is named Pangu when we will build DC system based on LUCA.IChing -  AI services platform At this phase  we will develop different types of AI services platform based on blockchain.Features of AI Services Platform:1. Common/Easy File Format: Users only need to save the data file as CSV. file which can be read by the AI services platform for forecasting services.2. Intuitive-designed Graphic Operation Interface: Programming beginners can easily use AIgatha AI services platform  skipping complicated developing process and background preparation.3. Multiple AI Agorithms: AIgatha AI servcies platfrom can operate popular AI agorithms and will conclude with the ultimate result based on the statistics of prediction results and the development of AIgatha's technologies.4. Forecasting Models: users can download the forecasting model built by AIgatha's AI services platform in case that it can be used for the similar topic in the future.5. Quality Data and Powerful Analysis: data mining and machine learning will help users to develop the best applications and produce the product by searching for the answers as soon as possible.6. Privacy and Safety: Since AIgatha's AI services platform will work out the forecasting based on statistics  users are not required to provide any name or description of eigenvalues in the dataset. The Chronos Fortress provides edge cache service that means highly privacy  consistency and extenability.7. Selection of Important Eigenvalues: AIgatha's AI services platform will select eigenvalues for users to know which eigenvalues in the dataset are the key to the prediction  making sure users get the answers together with reasons behind.8. Detailed and Complete Forecasting Analysis Report: Users are available to purchase the whole forecasting analysis report of the datasets that includes information processed by AI technologies such as relevant background values.Xirang - Complete Blockchain SystemIn this phase  we plan to build/implement forecasting platforms based on the existing architecture.Moreover  improved developing interface will encourage more developers to use our project developing platform. Our ultimate goal in this phase is to deploy the Chronos Fortress around the world.The ultimate goal of AIgatha is to build a complete blockchain system  specifically including:1. All suspending problems can resort to this blockchain for solutions.2. The feature of blockchain will help to store a large amount of data and ensure the reliability of the source.3. Key informations will be screened out among explosive data via the platform.4. Information will be gathered and technologies will be developed  in an accelerating speed.5. An open platform will be built.6. Users-friendly and graphic developing interface will be designed.7. Developers: they will make use of the existing computing power of the blockchain and focus on developing algorithms.8. Users: they will be able to purchase the solutions with AIgatha token.9.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/btrlyf, BtrLyf ,Convertible Note,BtrLyf (pronounced ‘better life’ is an open and unified digital platform that helps co-creation of sustainable buildings by enabling collaboration and AI-enabled assessment of green buildings and related solutions  instantly and at super low costs. Buildings consume 40% of energy and contribute to 30% of carbon emissions globally. Building Owners can save 30% to 40% in operating costs through proven green retrofit measures with an average IRR > 25%. IEA quantifies the green building market at $150 bn currently and the cumulative spend on building retrofits will exceed 7.2tn by 2040. However  building industry players do not have the tools to easily identify and quantify energy saving opportunities  evaluate  the latest technological solutions and access financing options. The lack of a unified data platform inhibits the growth of the industry. This in turn severely prohibits timely deployment of successful decarbonization strategies.BtrLyf is a unified green building market platform that helps accelerate sustainable development through digital co-creation. Our AI-enabled collaborative building simulation engine has been developed through several years of R&D with support from Singapore government grants. The platform aggregates multiple sources of data  including open source  API linked  and user entered data for ML processing and analytics. The resultant impact includes reduced transaction time  low marketing costs  shorter sales cycles  lower investment risk and improved productivity of business process by up to 10x. Our customers were able to quickly identify 30-50% savings at a fraction of the cost and time usually spent on green assessments towards net zero buildings., Analytics  Artificial Intelligence  Clean Energy  CleanTech  Green Building  GreenTech  Machine Learning  Real Estate  Smart Building  Sustainability, Singapore  Central Region  Singapore,BtrLyf is a digital platform for the built environment that helps co-creation of sustainable buildings,74 812,Jun 12  2017,Active,—, — , Asia-Pacific (APAC)  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Southeast Asia,—,—,For Profit, www.btrlyf.com/ ,https://www.facebook.com/thebtrlyf,https://www.linkedin.com/company/btrlyf/,https://www.twitter.com/Btrlyf_built,admyn@btrlyf.com,—,—, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Energy  Real Estate  Science and Engineering  Software  Sustainability,1, Nilesh Jadhav,11-50,4,—,Sep 1  2021,SGD180 000,SGD680 000,Corporate Round,SGD1 055 000,SGD1 235 000, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,9, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,35,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,75 437,—,-0.1,0,1.7

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/einsights, Einsights ,Seed,"Einsights was set up to solve a burning problem that is being exacerbated by the explosion in data generation – “How can they leverage data to make informed decisions that will unlock profits within my organisation or for my client?” The only logical answer was to deploy sophisticated technology in a manner that is transparent to the end user.Their humble beginnings can be traced back to eight rooms globally as the company started off with a virtual team (a great story over a drink someday!) and their first office was in a warehouse in Singapore (since it’s hard to find garages). Like most companies starting out  they had long delivery nights with pizzas and Cola  but they also had fun. Like most companies  they also struggled initially but were determined. Our metamorphosis into a company with operations in seven countries has been predominantly through word-of-mouth by clients and employees who are enthralled by their work.As the complexity in their daily life increases  they yearn for simplicity. The products that have changed lives have a common underlying theme – simplicity; for simplicity reduces stress and increases happiness in their lives.At Einsights  simplicity is deeply engrained in their DNA and is reflected in everything from product design to the user experience. Our mission is to democratise data and to simplify the corporate decision making process.They are creating a product that is beautiful yet powerful. They do use sophisticated technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing but they are transparent to the end user for the best feature they offer is the intuitive design.They are not just about insights and analysis – although they do that really well. At their core lies a passion to simplify lives.", Artificial Intelligence  Business Intelligence  Enterprise Software, Singapore  Central Region  Singapore,Einsights develop the business analytics tool built for the inquisitive mind.,454 018,2012,Active,—, — , Asia-Pacific (APAC)  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Southeast Asia,—,—,For Profit, einsights.com/ ,https://www.facebook.com/Einsights-488325491221961,https://www.linkedin.com/company/einsights-pte-ltd-,https://twitter.com/EinsightsBI,hello@einsights.com,(659)836-9864,—, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Science and Engineering  Software,1, Sandeep Rao,11-50,1,Seed,Oct 15  2015,—,—,Seed,—,—, Wavemaker Partners,—,1,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,2, — ,—,—,—,—,—,Computing; Calculating,0,1,20,—,3,14,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, Operations,1,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,467 472,—,2.1,-0.2,-0.7
