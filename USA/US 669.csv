https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/passivelogic, PassiveLogic ,Convertible Note,PassiveLogic’s mission is to empower people through generative autonomy to solve the world’s largest climate challenges. Buildings are the most complex controlled infrastructure in the world  however  they are often fitted with technologically stagnant and expensive control systems that waste energy and provide sub-optimal occupant comfort. The consequence of this inefficiency is that buildings account for more than 40% of the entire world's energy usage. Autonomous buildings are the key to addressing this energy challenge and unlocking the future of cities. PassiveLogic’s autonomous building platform  powered by Quantum - the physics-based digital twin standard for autonomous systems  has proven 30% energy savings compared to conventional control systems. Applying this scalable technology across the entire U.S. building sector alone creates a net savings opportunity of 9.6 Quads per year—the equivalent of taking 1/3 of all U.S. vehicles off the road.Founded in 2016 by Troy Harvey and backed by the world’s leading investors  PassiveLogic’s team is committed to developing extraordinary products that tackle the most challenging sustainability issues.

By maximizing the datacenter’s overall performance and cost efficiency  DPU is now considered as the most important HW/SW solution to realize the next-generation extreme-scale AI server infrastructure. However  despite its critical necessity from the datacenter and AI infrastructure  there is no market-leading DPU solution which can meet the customer’s actual demand due to its HW/SW complexity and the application/model heterogeneity.MangoBoost is currently the world’s most highly recognized DPU startup located in US and Korea. We provide the world’s most advanced and flexible DPU HW/SW solutions in order to fully satisfy the needs of various customers. Our DPU HW is fully composable by integrating its rich set of DPU features to construct our customer-optimal DPUs. At the same time  our DPU SW enables to seamlessly deploy the solution to any customer environment. As a result  our DPU solutions are considered very promising to realize the next-generation AI/datacenter infrastructure  and thus they are currently evaluated at various global-leading companies.MangoBoost was founded in early 2022 to commercialize 7 year of top-tier DPU research outcomes achieved at Seoul National University (e.g.  many full-system DPU prototypes  many ISCA/MICRO/ASPLOS/OSDI/ATC papers).

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/transparent-path, Transparent Path spc ,Grant,"SEED-STAGE • LOGISTICS TECH • FOR-PROFIT • SOCIAL PURPOSE CORPORATION. For buyers and sellers of perishable goods  Transparent Path creates real-time  end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste  cost  and risk. WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food  tech  and social impact sectors  from companies like Amazon  IBM  Xerox  Microsoft  Target  and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food  medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills. Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020. PROBLEMSupply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper  faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages  disruptions  and growing  complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges  including AI  IoT  5G  printed electronics  and machine vision.SOLUTIONSWe bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost  waste  and risk in perishable supply chains. -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location  temperature  humidity  and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked  easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball."" When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products  we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment  along with its freshness  safety  and financial value. -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data  allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers  minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED  the top food waste non-profit  to bring this technology to market.-- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our ""credit score for transparency."" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers  the higher the ProofScore. ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers  answering the question  where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development. -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.  BENEFITSOur products reduce customers' supply chain losses  retailer rejections  insurance premiums  wasted time  and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital  including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system  all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh  safe products at full margin. CUSTOMER PROFILETransparent Path technologies support food  pharmaceuticals  blood/plasma  transplant organs  and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods. PARTNERSHIPSTransparent Path has created partnerships with Intel  T-Mobile  Duke University  and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware  software  and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market  and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore. ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORSOver its short tenure  Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators  including 5G Open Innovation Lab  Microsoft for Startups  NewChip  and most recently  Plug and Play IoT. FUNDRAISINGTo date  Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping  two RegCF raises  three grants  and four angel investors. In April 2023  the company was awarded grants totaling $440 000 from the National Science Foundation  ReFED  and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.  FOR MORE INFORMATIONHeadquartered in the US  Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver  a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist.

The TruMedicines Pill Recognizer can be used as a software service (SAAS) for mobile applications  to identify pills that have been registered in our database. Using GPS locator of the phone app  Pharmaceutical pills can be tracked/trace/authenticated in compliance with the 2013 US Drug Security Act!  Able to to identify billions of individual drug tablets using an android smartphone app now available on Amazon Appshttps://goo.gl/m4WAhCBig Data Analytics for Big PharmaTruMedicines has patented a technology which allows a smartphone app to identify random patterns on drug pills. When a user scans a drug package barcode or pill  our 2 step  cloud based image recognition webservice performs image recognition matching to our image database on that drug tablet and provides text and audible information to the user-  What  when  where  expiration date  adverse reaction rate  adverse multi-drug reaction rate  customized messages from Drug Distributor. All data is in compliance with the 2013 Drug Security Act. (requires full track/trace compliance for all drugs sold in USA by 2017).  The Problems1) Counterfeit Drugs  - National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) found in 2010 that 97 percent of the more than 10 900 Internet pharmacies were selling counterfeit drugs. The World Health Organization reports counterfeit drugs cause 1Mil deaths/year in developing countries  India  Africa  and Asia. In the United States a rising occurrence of 100 000 deaths/year are caused by adverse drug reactions  drug mistakes and overdoses. Peter Pitts  president of The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and former FDA associate commissioner  estimates that in 2010  activities related to counterfeit drugs generated $75 billion  based on information obtained from government organizations. He expects it to grow by 20 percent annually in the coming years. If this estimate is correct  the counterfeit drug industry generates nearly as much cash as the world's fourth-largest wholesale drug company by revenue  AmerisourceBergen  which generated  $79 billion in 2012.2) Non-compliance to drug therapy (USA) - The annual costs of chronic conditions  such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease  are estimated to be $174 billion and $403 billion  respectively  in the United States. As these chronic disease costs continue to rise  managed care stakeholders and health insurance companies are continually looking for areas in which the quality of care can be improved and expenditures reduced. One such area is medication compliance  where increased compliance rates have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes and reduced overall medical expenditures.Source JMPC Jul 2008 vol 8•	up to 90% of diabetes patients do not take their medication well enough to benefit from that medication.•	33-50% of some cancer patients take less of their anti-cancer medicine than required.•	only 75% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients take sufficient medicine for it to be effective.•	Up to 75% of hypertensive patients do not adhere to their medicine.•	41-59% of mentally ill patients take their medication infrequently or not at all.•	33% of patients with schizophrenia don’t take their medicine at all  and 33% are poorly adherent.•	Less than 27% depressed patients adhere to their medication.The SolutionTruMedicines has transformed drug tablets into data source points  which can be used for individual health improvement and collectively as a public health data source. TruMedicines is a “game changer” for how medicine is administered and how customers interact with medicine.

Our software and multi-sensor devices are used by our customers for the commissioning and preventative maintenance of their large conveyor systems. Our systems are specifically designed to inspect and identify failure and pre-failure modes of conveyor systems. We do this through our unique patented approach called: On-Board Real-Time Multi-Sensor Diagnostics. This approach provides a connected  holistic first-person diagnostic view of the conveyor and its payload. Our systems provide a first-hand multi-sensor experience of the conveyor system route by either attaching to the tote/package or attaching to the moving parts of the conveyor itself  and use a unique set of cameras  sensors  thermography  and location synchronization to build a layered-holistic view of the health of the system. Some of the largest companies in the world use our “Mobile” Multi-Sensor conveyor diagnostic systems – 100’s of distribution centers in 8 countries. These devices are used to identify and alert via threshold events  impending or existing failure states for conveyance. Our customers typically make it mandatory for reliability engineers at their distribution facilities to use these systems to validate the commissioning phase for conveyors at new centers  as well as for routine maintenance at new and legacy centers. For the last 10 years  TinMan Systems has also been providing software and professional services for the development and deployment of real-time autonomous systems.

Carl Jung was a pioneering psychologist in the development of the concept of psychological or personality typing. The concept of psychological or personality typing was then expanded on by Isabel Briggs Myers with the creation of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Personality psychology is a branch of psychology in academia.IMPORTANT TO REMEMBERThe business landscape has changed. Customers are not only more difficult to acquire  keep  and grow  but also much harder to please  engage  connect  communicate  and build relationship with than ever before. Customers also own the relationship—not the company. Business success today requires a new depth of customer insight—an insight that is beyond any demographic  buyer  interest  financial  and lifestyle data. That insight is personality. Personality is the root of all behaviors  feelings  attitudes  desires  and needs. Personality is the piece that makes us unique. You use personality information to engage  connect  communicate  sell  and build relationship with customers. Keep in mind  we today can no longer think in terms of transactions  we think in terms of relationships.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/cascade-strategies-inc-, Cascade Strategies Inc. ,—,"Cascade’s BioNimbus enables high quality  affordable  customer controlled Market Research through its biometric panel and AI based analytics. BioNimbus allows for the real time gathering and analysis of discrete data emanating from the human body in response to varied stimuli through sensors or mobile wearables. The BioNimbus technology can be applied to anything that can be sensed (e.g. sound  smell  a human interaction  etc.) and the test outcome can be appropriately designed. BioNimbus is a powerful economic disruptive force  delivering similar or better analysis to the customer faster and at costs of $300 CPI (Cost per Interview) rather than $500 to $800 CPI.Using political analysis as an example  the BioNimbus technology conducted a study in October of 2016 with faculty members of the Texas Tech the College of Media and Communications. The study investigated what genuinely causes the hard-to-move undecided voters in elections to “budge”. Budging is defined as the act of finally moving an implacable undecided definitively toward a specific candidate. The stimuli used were specific candidate inflections (eleven primary inflections). BioNimbus’ AI tools analyzed the impulse data inflections most strongly statistically correlated with “budging”. The results of the study were almost identical  in terms of voter percentage  to the national election results.The BioNimbus technology has already been applied to Consumer Packaging (“CPG”) projects. BioNimbus enables rapid testing of design concepts allowing companies to determine suitability and engagement by users and consumers at all stages of a product life cycle. It is a powerful risk management tool for a company providing insights at the stages (i.e. design  concept  prototype) when it is more economic to make product changes. A client has a great deal of control with BioNimbus with the ability to set up tests and receive analysis of data in a dashboard format.BioNimbus has applicability for a wide range of vertical markets. Aside from political analysis and CPG  other markets include education (i.e. engagement testing of content preparation)  law enforcement and corrections (i.e. surveys and training of proper procedures) healthcare (i.e. labeling  protocol training) and government (i.e. armed forces training). Technology development and initial product trials to date has been funded internally by Cascade Strategies. Cascade Strategies is moving ahead to roll out the applications of the BioNimbus technology establishing partnerships involving analytics and operations partners  market research companies (sample providers  research services) and Product Lifecycle Management companies (major established and emerging design companies).", Analytics  Artificial Intelligence  Biometrics  Consumer Research  Market Research  Neuroscience  Politics  Predictive Analytics  Product Design  Wearables, Issaquah  Washington  United States,Cascade’s BioNimbus enables high quality  affordable  customer controlled Market Research through its biometric panel and AI based analytics,995 575,Jul 1  1991,Active,Less than $1M, — , Greater Seattle Area  West Coast  Western US,—,—,For Profit, www.cascadestrategies.com ,https://www.facebook.com/cascadestrategies,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cascade-strategies-inc.,https://www.twitter.com/cascadestrat,nestor@cascadestrategies.com,(201)323-2970,1, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Biotechnology  Consumer Electronics  Data and Analytics  Design  Government and Military  Hardware  Science and Engineering  Software,1, Jerry Johnson,1-10,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,4, — ,—,—,—,—,Advertising; business,Computing; Calculating,1,1,18,—,—,2,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, Operations  Pro Services,1,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,1 021 425,—,0.3,1.3,-0.3

Our AI model has been specifically designed to accelerate the advancement of clinical therapies and expand the reach and impact of these advancements. This will permit medicine to bring to reality the dream of equity inpatient care by accruing and sharing physicians’ cumulative discoveries  knowledge  and experiences with every single patient encounter.
