https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/sage-data-service, Sage Data Service ,—,SDS produces a machine learning tool for the financial services industry which dramatically reduces the cost of harvesting and cleaning data.  The company was founded in 2018 by a team of analysts and investment professionals who had formerly worked as part of a development group in a San Francisco angel capital office.  Previously  the team had been tasked with building various in-house data solutions  including one to supply structured XBRL financials to subsidiary Revere Data (later acquired by FACTSET).  It was through this experience that the basis of SDS as a standalone provider was born.  The lightbulb moment for the team came when it moved beyond standard financials (Income Statement/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) and began mining esoteric tables buried in 10K/Qs  such as REIT FFO (Funds From Operations) for a hedge fund manager client.  Although outside of the ordinary workflow  SDS tools easily accomplished the task with a skeleton crew of staff and a microscopic budget (compared to incumbent data purveyors).  At that point  the decision was made to commercialize.Since 2018  SDS has been in stealth mode  quietly improving its semantic parsing engine and its user interface  while preparing for a public launch.  We intend to disrupt a well established and very static industry which currently relies mostly on manual processes to populate databases.  Through automation  our platform improves the efficiency of collecting  maintaining  and updating financial information by an order of magnitude.
