Imagine AI's vision is to shape future production landscapes through being a technology company that builds the digital infrastructure for modern manufacturing. By applying computer vision  machine learning  simulation  and adaptive robotics to the factory floor  Imagine AI changes the scalability  resiliency  and economics of the industry. Imagine AI enables companies that make any product to use affordable solutions (like computer vision quality control inspection) to automate their operations and manage their production process with intelligent data and software. To-date  Imagine AI has substantial demand from several local manufacturers and is looking at expanding the affordable solutions outside Malaysia through various collaborative models.  We started this project in 2017 and spent a year on R&D to produce a successful Proof of Concept in June 2018. Please find attached a video of our first AI Vision QC Inspection Proof of Concept. After another two years on R&D  we have managed to localise the software and hardware in July 2020 and thus  successfully bringing the price of this exciting technology down. This has proven to be a significant milestone and inflexion point for us as we managed to achieve a performance over price ratio that is reasonable for local companies.   Our AI Vision & Robotics Demo Day can be reviewed at the following links:  Full video of Demo Day (1hr 5mins) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A9d2nlLmcyPUIBpiWwFK-JHDneg0QfDv/view?usp=sharing  Short Introduction Video Clip (14 mins) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJi0x0y9sOs08hczKpu8jtEEBansP_IZ/view?usp=sharing   Please also find attached our deck and our current product and solutions offering.  We are currently expanding our team  following up on several project leads and raising our seed round (USD400k-500k based on a valuation of USD4 million). We are also looking at building an open source platform for AI Vision and robotics technology and applications. It is our hope that more people can have access to this technology and to build solutions for industries.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/helloworld-robotics, HelloWorld Robotics ,Non-equity Assistance,When you place an order on online food platform sometimes you have to pay for 9% of service charges and tips besides delivery fee in Australia. Based on Mckinsey Report that the last mile delivery makes up to 53% of total logistics costs on any shipment. Its like you buy a $5 breakfast but you have to pay another $5 for delivery and this is NOT ok! If you've ever been waiting for a parcel eagerly when you are home or not home but you find out the delivery person has been gone and he didn't even call you or ring the bell and your parcel is just left outside of our house to weather being damaged or stolen. If any of this has ever happened to you  congratulations! You're most certainly NOT alone!So we are using autonomous robot to solve last mile delivery problems. The robot will delivery your packages or food by travelling on the sidewalk and pedestrian areas autonomously. It will be able to navigate itself to your doorstep and once the robot arrives  you can unlock the robot to pick up your package by using your phone otherwise the robot will unload the package into the Pre-installed secured safe drop automatically in front of the houses just in case failed deliveries. The robots will assist and help repetitive deliveries in the next following years. They are replacing humans and vehicles that may be doing those last one or two miles with autonomous robots. Our final goal is to reduce the delivery fee to $1. No matter how late you go home you can still get the parcel inside the secured safe box instead of driving all the way to the parcel locker just to pick up your item. You can also return your items easily at low cost  you can simply just put them back into the box and the robot will come and pick them up.

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/shelfie-robot, Shelfie Robot ,Series A,Shelfie is a Retail Shelf Analytics Platform which automates in-store tasks such as gaps monitoring and shelves restocking with an AI based system consistent across all stores.  It delivers automatic out-of-stock alerts at store level and consolidated reports and analysis at head-office level.  Shelfie is an exception based system that understands the “Perfect Shelf” and identifies anything that is not as it should be.    The Shelfie Index is transforming retail operations by helping to identify stock gaps  alerting staff to pricing and planogram discrepancies within the store and proving a new KPI that is all about the physical appearance of a store The Shelfie Robot is an autonomous robot that navigates itself around the store taking images for analysis by the Shelfie platform. The Shelfie fixed camera is a small device that can be placed anywhere in the store to fed data to the Shelfie platform.    Multiple fixed cameras can be installed within a store and are ideal for those areas of the store that are difficult for the robot to reach. The Shelfie handheld eye can be implemented on any iOS or Android device with sufficient camera resolution.  It gives ultimate flexibility to the Shelfie solution and creates a completely mobile eye for the platform. Shelfie Air is a drone version of the Shelfie Eye. With its much higher reach and broader range  Shelfie Air is designed to tackle operational challenges in the warehouse environment.   The Shelfie Index provides a means of comparing current shelf stock  planogram and pricing compliance with the ideal of “perfect” shelf.  It provides both staff and management a metric by which they can measure and compare re-stocking performance.  The Shelfie platform was created in response to major operational pain points identified in the retail industry.   Validated in the global market with Microsoft showcasing Shelfie in New York at the biggest global retail technology show.   From that point Shelfie has quickly moved from concept to production. The Shelfie platform has been tested in many retail environments now and the underlying platform is proving to be very valuable to the store operations. , Artificial Intelligence  Computer  Machine Learning  Retail  Software, Manly  Queensland  Australia,Shelfie Robot is a Retail Shelf Analytics Platform.,455 482,Jan 2017,Active,Less than $1M, — , Asia-Pacific (APAC)  Australasia,—,—,For Profit, shelfierobot.com/ ,—,https://www.linkedin.com/company/17911114/,https://twitter.com/Shelfierobot,info@shelfierobot.com,+61 1300656706,—, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Commerce and Shopping  Consumer Electronics  Data and Analytics  Hardware  Science and Engineering  Software,—, — ,11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,Apr 30  2020,—,—,Series A,—,—, DTRIBE Capital,—,1,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,3, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,23,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,468 980,—,0,0,-0.3
