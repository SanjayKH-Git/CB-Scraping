Segmentations provide quantitative metrics and help plan for surgeries by viewing 3D models  or 3D printing structures.

Build your machine learning pipeline with the right abstractions to both ease research  development  and deployment of your ML applications.____________________________________________From defining the problem to implementing the key solution  multiple special steps are to be considered when working with machine learning pipelines. Assuming you already have the data  Neuraxio can assist you in creating a good model (e.g.: a deep neural network) to do predictions on the data.Depending on the amount of data you have  the best model to use may change. If the amount of data you have comes to change  it could mean you need to do many solutions. Automatic Machine Learning could be useful in this case.In the context of Research and Development (R&D) projects  it's not uncommon to create and evaluate multiple different prototypes  following the scientific method. Good news: it's possible to automatically combine many machine learning models such that the resulting predictions are better  which makes the R&D process even more interesting from a business point of view.Learn more by visiting our website., Artificial Intelligence  B2B  Business Intelligence  Consulting  Intelligent Systems  Natural Language Processing  Predictive Analytics  Productivity Tools  Software  Software Engineering, Quebec  Quebec  Canada,Deep Learning  Machine Learning,579 649,May 18  2018,Active,—, — , — ,—,—,For Profit, www.neuraxio.com/ ,https://www.facebook.com/Neuraxio/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuraxio/,https://twitter.com/Neuraxio_Inc,info@neuraxio.com,418-262-7912,1, —,—,—, —, —, Artificial Intelligence  Data and Analytics  Other  Professional Services  Science and Engineering  Software,1, Guillaume Chevalier,1-10,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, — ,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,Private,—,—,—,—,—,—,2,—,—,27, — ,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,78,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—, —,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,—,596 573,—,-0.3,0,0

https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/broadside-media, Broadside Media ,—,"Marketing and corporate communication efforts  no matter how impressive  are often developed in a silo instead of flowing directly from the top goals of the organization.  Our approach to marketing strategy starts with taking stock of business goals  and analyzing existing data in order to develop a strategic plan of action.PROPRIETARY PLATFORMOur on-the-fly adjustable quality assurance algorithms ensure the highest quality leads are generated in real-time. Feedback provided through out 6 step feedback loop ensure any lagging indicators are addressed and optimized to ensure point-to-point success.SCIENTIFIC APPROACHEverything we do  we test. Our predictive analytical platform allows us to use statistical analysis to extract hidden predictive information using big data to isolate patterns which help us identify your target buyer and the right timing. This combined with our extensive fractional-factorial testing allows us to remove opinions  biases and pre-conceived notions from all design of experiments (DOE) while remaining 95% statistically confident in our decisions.STATISTICALLY DRIVEN  TECHNOLOGY ENABLEDAnalytics are our lifeblood  and that is how we determine which changes really affect our clients’ bottom line. We track every interaction between our custom campaigns and our end customer. This allows us to analyze the return our efforts are generating and adapt as needed to your requirements. Monitoring every detail takes constant attention and agile planning  but it allows us to identify and zero in on the metrics that matter.LEAD MANAGEMENT PROCESSImplementing best-practice is the name of the game. Our philosophical integration between web-traffic-generation and traffic-conversion-tactics enables you to hit the ground running; allowing you to efficiently convert leads using tried and tested contact schedule strategies.EXPERTISE AND ACCOUNTABILITYWe provide you with an outsourced online-marketing partner that you can rely on.
