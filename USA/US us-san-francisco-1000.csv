https://www.crunchbase.com//organization/beautiful-ai, Beautiful.AI ,Series B,The Beautiful.AI team has spent decades working on presentations—writing them  designing them  and building software to make them. During that time  we’ve watched way too many people bang their heads against the wall trying to turn ideas into visual presentations. And so we decided to do something about it.We believe that the only way to guarantee good presentation design is to build the intelligence of a designer directly into the tool. Thus  Beautiful.AI suggests ways to visualize your ideas and makes it incredibly easy to customize the design. It knows what’s on your slide  what you might add later  and how to adjust the layout when you do. (And we’d like to think it has pretty good taste  too).We are constantly working to make Beautiful.AI  better—adding more templates and design options  improving our recommendations  and making it even easier for you to do beautiful work.

Healthcare systems and data aggregators are forced to impose ever greater barriers to clinical data access. Syntegra is unique in developing a very large  open-access data platform of high quality  patient-level real-world data  trained using modern machine learning methods on health system information. Users can leverage our platform to conduct analytics  building predictive models  generating synthetic control groups for clinical trials and more.Since training is done on data at rest  and only deep learning model parameters are sent from the Syntegra API to the Syntegra servers  there is no risk of identifiable personal information leaving our secure platform. To satisfy health system security teams and end-users  numerous methods of validation  leak-testing and benchmarking are applied to the data derivatives before they pierce the health system’s firewall. Syntegra’s solution is scalable  and usable across many types of data  from images to financial information to sensor streams  will be securely added to our data lake over time.
