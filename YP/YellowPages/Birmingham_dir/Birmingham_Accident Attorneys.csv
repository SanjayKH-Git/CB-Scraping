Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

We offer our services at hourly rates lower than those billed by larger firms for attorneys of comparable or less experience, and we do not bill for the countless expenses usually tacked on to others' already exorbitant legal fees.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system.

Although the early focus of the practice was criminal defense, as the years, partners and associates have come and gone, our practice area has grown to incorporate business law, civil litigation, matrimonial and family law, and probate matters.  The firm's rich history includes members of the 1901 Alabama Constitutional Convention, the 10th Judicial Circuit Court, and the Alabama Supreme Court. Our members have been past presidents of the Alabama Bar Association, Committee members of the Legal Aid Board tasked with the establishment of Legal Aid Clinics, as well as the Grievance and Ethics Committee, and the Alabama State Bar Fee Arbitration Committee.  Our firm is well known for never shying away from representing unpopular clients. Periodically, such representation would result in the creation of important new law. For example, our involvement in the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan case, resulted in a United States Supreme Court decision which established the actual malice standard in libel and defamation law and is a key decision supporting freedom of the press.  Beddow, Erben and Bowen, PA is the firm it is now because of Frederick A. Erben who has practiced here since he was admitted to the Bar in 1966. Through his leadership, our practice has and will continue to expand beyond its original focus. During his tenure, he was mentored by Roderick Beddow, Jr., and practiced with other lawyers who have since become Circuit Court and Alabama Supreme Court justices. Among other milestones during his practice, Mr. Erben and the firm participated in Civil Rights era cases, argued before the first Jefferson County Alabama jury to include women, and won sizeable monetary judgments against corporations, cities and insurance companies. Because of the influence of our talented past and present members, we are currently a firm uniquely prepared to handle almost any legal issue for any client."

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas.

Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system.
