ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines.

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

We take pride in delivering a higher level of quality service.  
ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines. In 2012, again by popular demand and multiple customer requests, Rob'e Mans extended its professional service to include the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Today, Eddie Cleveland and the staff at Robe Mans continues to provide the kind of customer-focused service that started back in 1983, earning and keeping the trust of his customers by providing quality services with a personal touch."

ABOUT US.....As childhood friends, Eddie Cleveland and Angelo Roberson shared a passion for figuring out how things worked; specifically motorcycles and cars. More to the point, they spent a lot of time figuring out why something didnt work. Like most passions, it was only a matter of time before it became a profession. In 1983, Eddie and Angelo formed Robe Mans, working as mechanics servicing only Honda vehicles. When Honda introduced the upscale Acura line, they started servicing the Acura line. As time passed on, health concerns drove Angelo to retire. Eddie continued to run the ever-growing business, concentrating on maintaining the kind of personal and professional service that has earned Robe Mans a stellar reputation. In 2006, after numerous customer requests, Robe Mans decided to extend their services to include Toyota and Lexus, purchasing the building next door to their existing facility to accommodate the newly added lines.
