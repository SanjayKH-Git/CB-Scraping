Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results.
