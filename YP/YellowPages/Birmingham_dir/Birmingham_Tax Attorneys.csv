Most of the clients of Cunningham Firm, LLC are small to medium sized businesses ( often referred to as ""emerging businesses"" ) and the owners of such businesses. However, the firm does a variety of work for large corporations ( e.g., representing publicly traded financial institutions in commercial real estate financing transactions and representing publicly traded insurance companies with respect to their local real estate holdings ) as well as non-business owning individuals ( e.g., representing individuals before the Internal Revenue Service or the Alabama Department of Revenue ). Whether the client is an individual or a business, the focus of Cunningham Firm, LLC has always been providing efficient and cost effective legal services. This is important to our clients, because most have a limited budget for legal services. We believe that the daily challenge of solving our client's legal problems on a limited budget makes us a better law firm. We strive to work with a diverse clientele. The diversity of our client base makes our work more interesting and keeps us informed of legal issues facing multiple industries. As part of its commitment to provide quality legal services to its clients, Cunningham Firm, LLC formed the alliance of Red Mountain Law along with other small Birmingham, Alabama law firms in 2006. Membership in this association provides firm clients access to a broader range of legal expertise than would otherwise be available at the firm. For more information about Red Mountain Law, please visit its website at www.redmountainlaw.com."

Most of the clients of Cunningham Firm, LLC are small to medium sized businesses ( often referred to as ""emerging businesses"" ) and the owners of such businesses. However, the firm does a variety of work for large corporations ( e.g., representing publicly traded financial institutions in commercial real estate financing transactions and representing publicly traded insurance companies with respect to their local real estate holdings ) as well as non-business owning individuals ( e.g., representing individuals before the Internal Revenue Service or the Alabama Department of Revenue ). Whether the client is an individual or a business, the focus of Cunningham Firm, LLC has always been providing efficient and cost effective legal services. This is important to our clients, because most have a limited budget for legal services. We believe that the daily challenge of solving our client's legal problems on a limited budget makes us a better law firm. We strive to work with a diverse clientele. The diversity of our client base makes our work more interesting and keeps us informed of legal issues facing multiple industries. As part of its commitment to provide quality legal services to its clients, Cunningham Firm, LLC formed the alliance of Red Mountain Law along with other small Birmingham, Alabama law firms in 2006. Membership in this association provides firm clients access to a broader range of legal expertise than would otherwise be available at the firm. For more information about Red Mountain Law, please visit its website at www.redmountainlaw.com."
