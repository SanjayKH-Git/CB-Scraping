Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

In 1974 Adam Austin (who previously owned Crestwood Barber Shop) came over the mountain and purchased the shop from the original owners. In 1978 Adam was joined by his daughter, Donna Austin McLaurin. Along came Randy McArthur (who owned and operated the barber school where Donna learned the trade) in 1979 and the three of them enjoyed growing the business and working together. Within a matter of 10 years they outgrew the original location and moved down the hill, next to Marks Outdoors. They have remained here for the past 27 years. Staying true to family owned and operated, they were joined by Randys sister, Melanie McArthur Miller who has been cutting alongside them for 28 years. This shop sets itself apart by having low turnover in employment, an example being Dana Jacobs who has worked here 18 years. In 2010, Adams granddaughter, Stevie McLaurin joined the team to keep the tradition going."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

In 1974 Adam Austin (who previously owned Crestwood Barber Shop) came over the mountain and purchased the shop from the original owners. In 1978 Adam was joined by his daughter, Donna Austin McLaurin. Along came Randy McArthur (who owned and operated the barber school where Donna learned the trade) in 1979 and the three of them enjoyed growing the business and working together. Within a matter of 10 years they outgrew the original location and moved down the hill, next to Marks Outdoors. They have remained here for the past 27 years. Staying true to family owned and operated, they were joined by Randys sister, Melanie McArthur Miller who has been cutting alongside them for 28 years. This shop sets itself apart by having low turnover in employment, an example being Dana Jacobs who has worked here 18 years. In 2010, Adams granddaughter, Stevie McLaurin joined the team to keep the tradition going."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

In 1974 Adam Austin (who previously owned Crestwood Barber Shop) came over the mountain and purchased the shop from the original owners. In 1978 Adam was joined by his daughter, Donna Austin McLaurin. Along came Randy McArthur (who owned and operated the barber school where Donna learned the trade) in 1979 and the three of them enjoyed growing the business and working together. Within a matter of 10 years they outgrew the original location and moved down the hill, next to Marks Outdoors. They have remained here for the past 27 years. Staying true to family owned and operated, they were joined by Randys sister, Melanie McArthur Miller who has been cutting alongside them for 28 years. This shop sets itself apart by having low turnover in employment, an example being Dana Jacobs who has worked here 18 years. In 2010, Adams granddaughter, Stevie McLaurin joined the team to keep the tradition going."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

In 1974 Adam Austin (who previously owned Crestwood Barber Shop) came over the mountain and purchased the shop from the original owners. In 1978 Adam was joined by his daughter, Donna Austin McLaurin. Along came Randy McArthur (who owned and operated the barber school where Donna learned the trade) in 1979 and the three of them enjoyed growing the business and working together. Within a matter of 10 years they outgrew the original location and moved down the hill, next to Marks Outdoors. They have remained here for the past 27 years. Staying true to family owned and operated, they were joined by Randys sister, Melanie McArthur Miller who has been cutting alongside them for 28 years. This shop sets itself apart by having low turnover in employment, an example being Dana Jacobs who has worked here 18 years. In 2010, Adams granddaughter, Stevie McLaurin joined the team to keep the tradition going."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

In 1974 Adam Austin (who previously owned Crestwood Barber Shop) came over the mountain and purchased the shop from the original owners. In 1978 Adam was joined by his daughter, Donna Austin McLaurin. Along came Randy McArthur (who owned and operated the barber school where Donna learned the trade) in 1979 and the three of them enjoyed growing the business and working together. Within a matter of 10 years they outgrew the original location and moved down the hill, next to Marks Outdoors. They have remained here for the past 27 years. Staying true to family owned and operated, they were joined by Randys sister, Melanie McArthur Miller who has been cutting alongside them for 28 years. This shop sets itself apart by having low turnover in employment, an example being Dana Jacobs who has worked here 18 years. In 2010, Adams granddaughter, Stevie McLaurin joined the team to keep the tradition going."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

In 1974 Adam Austin (who previously owned Crestwood Barber Shop) came over the mountain and purchased the shop from the original owners. In 1978 Adam was joined by his daughter, Donna Austin McLaurin. Along came Randy McArthur (who owned and operated the barber school where Donna learned the trade) in 1979 and the three of them enjoyed growing the business and working together. Within a matter of 10 years they outgrew the original location and moved down the hill, next to Marks Outdoors. They have remained here for the past 27 years. Staying true to family owned and operated, they were joined by Randys sister, Melanie McArthur Miller who has been cutting alongside them for 28 years. This shop sets itself apart by having low turnover in employment, an example being Dana Jacobs who has worked here 18 years. In 2010, Adams granddaughter, Stevie McLaurin joined the team to keep the tradition going."
