Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

We value our clients and always want to provide them with the best possible eating experience.

Our retail store has quickly grown and we now sell frozen dinners, chicken salad, and many desserts. Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

The idea was to create a restaurant where people would feel welcome to be themselves, families could afford to dine out together and strangers would leave as friends. Coastal vacationers demanded that Shrimp Basket expand to provide this incredible seafood value to those unable to be at the beach year round. Today, weâ??re happy to offer locations across the Southeast for family and friends to feel a part of the beach, dine and enjoy delicious seafood! At the Shrimp Basket, our goal is to make sure that you - our friends - leave happy and satisfied after every visit."

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

The idea was to create a restaurant where people would feel welcome to be themselves, families could afford to dine out together and strangers would leave as friends. Coastal vacationers demanded that Shrimp Basket expand to provide this incredible seafood value to those unable to be at the beach year round. Today, weâ??re happy to offer locations across the Southeast for family and friends to feel a part of the beach, dine and enjoy delicious seafood! At the Shrimp Basket, our goal is to make sure that you - our friends - leave happy and satisfied after every visit."

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

The idea was to create a restaurant where people would feel welcome to be themselves, families could afford to dine out together and strangers would leave as friends. Coastal vacationers demanded that Shrimp Basket expand to provide this incredible seafood value to those unable to be at the beach year round. Today, weâ??re happy to offer locations across the Southeast for family and friends to feel a part of the beach, dine and enjoy delicious seafood!
