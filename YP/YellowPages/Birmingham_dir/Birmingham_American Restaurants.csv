Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year.

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights.

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Sherry Snyder, our founder's mother, was most at home in the kitchen modeling made-from-scratch cooking to her sons.

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Way back before ‘gourmet burgers’ was a thing, Chefs Jason Boso & Quincy Hart decided to build a restaurant around half-pound, fresh ground burgers with a menu that allowed customers to build their own burgers with a list of crazy and inventive toppings. The two met in culinary school, after jobs in stock brokerages and telephone line repair. After paying their dues working the line at The Four Seasons & Pappas Bros, Jason & Quincy finally opened Twisted Root Burger Co. in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, Texas in 2006. Twisted Root appeared on the second season of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri (2009) and suddenly Twisted Root was a dining destination in Dallas. While Twisted Root Burger Co. has seen incredible growth, Jason & Quincy have stuck to their roots and their senses of humor, using a hands-on approach to high-quality, fresh food in an casual atmosphere with tons of personality."

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

The two met in culinary school, after jobs in stock brokerages and telephone line repair. After paying their dues working the line at The Four Seasons & Pappas Bros, Jason & Quincy finally opened Twisted Root Burger Co. in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, Texas in 2006. Twisted Root appeared on the second season of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri (2009) and suddenly Twisted Root was a dining destination in Dallas. While Twisted Root Burger Co. has seen incredible growth, Jason & Quincy have stuck to their roots and their senses of humor, using a hands-on approach to high-quality, fresh food in an casual atmosphere with tons of personality."

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

The two met in culinary school, after jobs in stock brokerages and telephone line repair. After paying their dues working the line at The Four Seasons & Pappas Bros, Jason & Quincy finally opened Twisted Root Burger Co. in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, Texas in 2006. Twisted Root appeared on the second season of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri (2009) and suddenly Twisted Root was a dining destination in Dallas.

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

After paying their dues working the line at The Four Seasons & Pappas Bros, Jason & Quincy finally opened Twisted Root Burger Co. in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, Texas in 2006. Twisted Root appeared on the second season of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri (2009) and suddenly Twisted Root was a dining destination in Dallas.

Each and every Whataburger® is still made to order. We still use 100% pure beef and serve it on a big, toasted five-inch bun.

Bob Sykes began in 1957, serving classic bbq and burgers with only curbside service and was one of the first restaurants to open Drive-Thru service in Alabama. Times may have changed but nothing has changed in the way Bob Sykes prepares and serves their famous barbecue, sides, and desserts. Bob Sykes offers Drive-Thru, Take-Out, Curbside, Call-In’s, Online Ordering and Catering-Delivery Services. In 2014, Bob Sykes was voted as the number one bbq sauce and their bbq pork sandwich was chosen as one of the “100 dishes to eat in Alabama before you die.”"

Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""

Today, weâ??re happy to offer locations across the Southeast for family and friends to feel a part of the beach, dine and enjoy delicious seafood! At the Shrimp Basket, our goal is to make sure that you - our friends - leave happy and satisfied after every visit."

Ashley Mac's Strawberry Cake is our best seller and is quickly becoming a favorite with Birmingham residents as well as throughout the state. Check out our menus page for a look at our corporate, storefront, and dessert offerings! Ashley & Andy McMakin Ashley ( Deaton ) McMakin grew up in Birmingham with her parents, Ken and Sandy Deaton, and three brothers, Sam, Scott, and Tyler. After graduating from Briarwood High School, she attended the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Campus Crusade for Christ. In 2003, she married her husband, Andy McMakin, who encouraged her to pursue her dreams. As husband and business partner, he is a constant support in the company's rapid growth. ""After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Marketing I found myself longing to go to Culinary School but settling for a desk job. Always craving an outlet to develop my love of cooking, I started a little ""hobby"" with one of my co-workers. We each put up $250 in a joint checking account and starting calling our friends to see if they needed any catering. Several friends were drug reps and immediately began using us to cater lunches for their doctors. Within three months we were catering 5 or 6 events a week and were forced to quit our full-time jobs. Blessed by word-of-mouth, people kept calling, and calling, and calling! Eight more months passed and I bought my partner out due to her pregnancy. That left me with LOTS of work ( in my tiny Homewood kitchen ) and little help. My husband, Andy, a C.P.A working at a Mountain Brook Accounting Firm, quit his job and joined me full-time. He was determined to not only keep my business alive, but to grow it substantially by finding a kitchen to operate the business. After six months of searching all over Birmingham, he happened upon a vacant little tea room in Bluff Park. We immediately fell in love with the place and renovated it to fit our needs. On June 16th, 2007 Ashley Mac's officially opened for business. We immediately hired two people to come and help us out. That number grew to seven in the course of the first year. The following year, in November of 2008, we opened our second location in Cahaba Heights. We are continually amazed at the rapid growth of our business and are so thankful for how the Lord has blessed it."""
