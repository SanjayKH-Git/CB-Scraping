And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas.

Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.

With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system. Since 2017, DiCello Levitt has advanced the law to provide enhanced cybersecurity, product safety, civil rights and human rights protections, and governmental transparency.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.

With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system. Since 2017, DiCello Levitt has advanced the law to provide enhanced cybersecurity, product safety, civil rights and human rights protections, and governmental transparency.

The firm represents businesses, individuals, and public clients injured by the wrongs of others. DiCello Levitt works tirelessly to secure a more just and equitable future for its clients. And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system. Since 2017, DiCello Levitt has advanced the law to provide enhanced cybersecurity, product safety, civil rights and human rights protections, and governmental transparency. When you work with DiCello Levitt, you’re not only protecting your own rights and future, but you’re also meaningfully contributing to a safer, fairer world."

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.

When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start.

Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.

With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority.

And with more than $18 billion in recoveries since 2017, DiCello Levitt is off to a great start. 
 
For the most part, DiCello Levitt restricts its practice to the representation of plaintiffs, most of which need help with complex litigation matters. Because DiCello Levitt hires talented lawyers who share the firm’s values and offer a breadth of experience and expertise, DiCello Levitt is regularly a first choice for clients looking for top-flight legal representation in class action, mass tort, public client, whistleblower/qui tam, cybersecurity, complex commercial, securities, and financial services litigation, to name just a few of our practice areas. Our “trial first” philosophy, respected courtroom acumen, and unyielding dedication sets industry standards, advances the law, and results in larger settlements and verdicts than in other similar cases. 
 
Standing idly by is not an option for DiCello Levitt. Every day, in every way, we’re working to provide a fairer and safer world. That’s why, in just a few years’ time, we’ve expanded from 11 lawyers in two offices to more than 40 lawyers in seven offices nationwide. We go wherever in the world we need to go for our clients, and we innovate to achieve historic results. When we see opportunities to make a larger, more meaningful impact, we strategize and do just that.   
 
We also recognize that the cause of justice starts at home. With a less hierarchical approach to law firm management, DiCello Levitt fosters trust and communication within the firm that benefits our team and our clients. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are essential elements of a thriving community, and we actively recruit women, minority, and LGBTQ lawyers who demonstrate acumen and responsibility, regardless of their seniority. 
 
DiCello Levitt focuses on more than just achieving “best in class” results for our clients. One of our goals is for our cases to change human and corporate behavior so that we’re all safer in the future. Another is to influence society and the law to ensure a more responsible and dignified justice system. Since 2017, DiCello Levitt has advanced the law to provide enhanced cybersecurity, product safety, civil rights and human rights protections, and governmental transparency.
