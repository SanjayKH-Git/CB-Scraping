Powell, Dr. Dewey H. Jones III, and Dr. Dewey H. Jones IV are orthopedic surgeons who regard minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and regenerative therapies not only as their passion, but also as their calling. Our doctors offer compassionate orthopedic care and spend ample time listening to their patients to develop customized surgical and non-surgical solutions for relieving pain, stiffness, swelling, and movement limitations. Our physicians are truly dedicated to their craft, treating people with general orthopedic conditions such as fractures, sports injuries, work-related injuries, and joint disease. In addition to performing arthroscopy, joint replacement surgery, and general orthopedic surgery, our surgeons perform surgery for the foot, ankle, hip, knee, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Some of our physicians also administer ultrasound-guided medication injections to help relieve joint pain."

Powell, Dr. Dewey H. Jones III, and Dr. Dewey H. Jones IV are orthopedic surgeons who regard minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and regenerative therapies not only as their passion, but also as their calling. Our doctors offer compassionate orthopedic care and spend ample time listening to their patients to develop customized surgical and non-surgical solutions for relieving pain, stiffness, swelling, and movement limitations. Our physicians are truly dedicated to their craft, treating people with general orthopedic conditions such as fractures, sports injuries, work-related injuries, and joint disease. In addition to performing arthroscopy, joint replacement surgery, and general orthopedic surgery, our surgeons perform surgery for the foot, ankle, hip, knee, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Some of our physicians also administer ultrasound-guided medication injections to help relieve joint pain."
