Putting your home up for sale? A PODS container can provide you with a secure storage option to store extra belongings so you can renovate or stage your home with ease! PODS containers are not only affordable, they are convenient. You can store onsite or in one of our secure PODS storage centers. You decide how long you will keep your PODS storage container and when you will need it back. 
If you are moving, PODS containers are an ideal solution. Delivered right to your door, they are available in three sizes. Since PODS containers sit at ground level, loading and unloading items is convenient too. There are no ramps or steps to navigate. With PODS you can take your time (weeks if needed) and alleviate the stress. Once all of your personal belongings are packed and loaded, provide your own lock on the roll-down door and you keep the key. PODS will retrieve the container and transport it to your new home or back to a local Storage Center until you are ready for your belongings to be delivered to your new home. PODS offers 24-hour service, it takes just one telephone call for re-delivery of the PODS container and your belongings – across town or across the country."

Putting your home up for sale? A PODS container can provide you with a secure storage option to store extra belongings so you can renovate or stage your home with ease! PODS containers are not only affordable, they are convenient. You can store onsite or in one of our secure PODS storage centers. You decide how long you will keep your PODS storage container and when you will need it back. 
If you are moving, PODS containers are an ideal solution. Delivered right to your door, they are available in three sizes. Since PODS containers sit at ground level, loading and unloading items is convenient too. There are no ramps or steps to navigate. With PODS you can take your time (weeks if needed) and alleviate the stress. Once all of your personal belongings are packed and loaded, provide your own lock on the roll-down door and you keep the key. PODS will retrieve the container and transport it to your new home or back to a local Storage Center until you are ready for your belongings to be delivered to your new home. PODS offers 24-hour service, it takes just one telephone call for re-delivery of the PODS container and your belongings – across town or across the country."

Putting your home up for sale? A PODS container can provide you with a secure storage option to store extra belongings so you can renovate or stage your home with ease! PODS containers are not only affordable, they are convenient. You can store onsite or in one of our secure PODS storage centers. You decide how long you will keep your PODS storage container and when you will need it back. 
If you are moving, PODS containers are an ideal solution. Delivered right to your door, they are available in three sizes. Since PODS containers sit at ground level, loading and unloading items is convenient too. There are no ramps or steps to navigate. With PODS you can take your time (weeks if needed) and alleviate the stress. Once all of your personal belongings are packed and loaded, provide your own lock on the roll-down door and you keep the key. PODS will retrieve the container and transport it to your new home or back to a local Storage Center until you are ready for your belongings to be delivered to your new home. PODS offers 24-hour service, it takes just one telephone call for re-delivery of the PODS container and your belongings – across town or across the country."
