The secret to longevity consists of a combination of things ultimately involving hard work, determination, and creative ideas. In 2004, my husband and I relocated from Dallas, Texas consumed with plans to continue the legacy of my father-n-law, Nolan James Hatcher, Founder of Hatcher's Florist. Committed to contribute the sweat, tears, and tender loving care required to have a successful business as he did for 34 years. With our faith to sustain us and the belief in our ability to continue to produce such beautiful gifts for others ; a new chapter begins. A vision of old world flavor with a modern twist of flair will be our inspiration. Our approach to floral design is pure and natural and it explores not only the character of flowers, individually and in combination, but also the aesthetic relationship between flowers and their settings. With this approach in mind along with dedication to our customers, we strive to provide premier quality and service at all times with a distinctive style."

At FTD, we know that beautiful flowers are a special way to celebrate and honor life's most memorable moments. Our tradition of excellence in flower delivery began over 100 years ago in 1910 when 13 florists joined together to send floral orders across the U.S. by telegraph. Today, as one of the largest and most trusted online floral and gift retailers in the world, we take pride in being a leader in quality, innovation, artistry and dependability."
