Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options. Hope Drug & Alcohol Rehab Center provide safe environments designed to help you free your body of alcohol and other drugs. But treatment doesn’t end with detox. We teach healthy coping strategies, stress-relief techniques and skills to set you up for success. Recovery is a lifelong journey. It’s easier when you’re surrounded by support. Drug rehab prepares you for a life in recovery by guiding your transition after treatment and introducing you to support groups.

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options. Hope Drug & Alcohol Rehab Center provide safe environments designed to help you free your body of alcohol and other drugs. But treatment doesn’t end with detox. We teach healthy coping strategies, stress-relief techniques and skills to set you up for success. Recovery is a lifelong journey. It’s easier when you’re surrounded by support. Drug rehab prepares you for a life in recovery by guiding your transition after treatment and introducing you to support groups. Whether you’re in recovery or you’re supporting a loved one, support options are available for you. Give us a call (205) 809-8008"

Pearson Hall, Olivia’s House, and the Zukoski Center all provide services operated by ADATC. ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options.

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options. Hope Drug & Alcohol Rehab Center provide safe environments designed to help you free your body of alcohol and other drugs. But treatment doesn’t end with detox. We teach healthy coping strategies, stress-relief techniques and skills to set you up for success. Recovery is a lifelong journey. It’s easier when you’re surrounded by support. Drug rehab prepares you for a life in recovery by guiding your transition after treatment and introducing you to support groups. Whether you’re in recovery or you’re supporting a loved one, support options are available for you. Give us a call (205) 809-8008"

Pearson Hall, Olivia’s House, and the Zukoski Center all provide services operated by ADATC. ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease.

We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options.

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options. Hope Drug & Alcohol Rehab Center provide safe environments designed to help you free your body of alcohol and other drugs. But treatment doesn’t end with detox. We teach healthy coping strategies, stress-relief techniques and skills to set you up for success. Recovery is a lifelong journey. It’s easier when you’re surrounded by support. Drug rehab prepares you for a life in recovery by guiding your transition after treatment and introducing you to support groups. Whether you’re in recovery or you’re supporting a loved one, support options are available for you. Give us a call (205) 809-8008"

Pearson Hall, Olivia’s House, and the Zukoski Center all provide services operated by ADATC. ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease.

We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options.

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options. Hope Drug & Alcohol Rehab Center provide safe environments designed to help you free your body of alcohol and other drugs. But treatment doesn’t end with detox. We teach healthy coping strategies, stress-relief techniques and skills to set you up for success. Recovery is a lifelong journey. It’s easier when you’re surrounded by support. Drug rehab prepares you for a life in recovery by guiding your transition after treatment and introducing you to support groups. Whether you’re in recovery or you’re supporting a loved one, support options are available for you. Give us a call (205) 809-8008"

Pearson Hall, Olivia’s House, and the Zukoski Center all provide services operated by ADATC. ADATC is certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation.The priorities of admission are (1) Pregnant IV drug users (2) Pregnant substance abuse users and (3) IV users.  Like any other disease, alcoholism or drug addiction requires professional treatment. It is a primary, progressive, and fatal disease, without treatment it will get worse—never better. Yet, some individuals and families still try to treat this disease alone. Unfortunately, improvements are always temporary, and the relapses are always more severe.  However, with treatment and abstinence, there is a one hundred percent chance of recovery. That’s truly an amazing statistic! It’s possible with professional help.  What happens when people recover? They get healthier and  learn to feel good about themselves. Relationships with family and friends improve. They can laugh and feel joy. All in all, life gets better—a whole lot better. Our mission and desire is to be the premier provider of behavioral health and related issues. We strive to accomplish this by understanding our patients’ needs, applying the talents of our exceptional therapists, keeping abreast of all the new behavioral methods, promoting an environment of patient satisfaction and consistently delivering excellence."

People often use drugs as an outlet for their problems, although drug use creates its own problems over time. Drug addiction not only affects a person’s health and relationships, but also impacts society and the environment. There are numerous treatment options to guide people toward a sober and healthy life. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It tricks the brain into thinking that drugs are essential despite negative consequences. Addiction compels individuals to go to great lengths to acquire their drugs of abuse. We provide information, resources, and treatment for people battling addiction and related conditions. Rehab for alcohol and drug abuse requires a personal approach. It should be tailored to your needs. We work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that includes individual therapy, counseling, group therapy and medication-assisted treatment options. Hope Drug & Alcohol Rehab Center provide safe environments designed to help you free your body of alcohol and other drugs. But treatment doesn’t end with detox. We teach healthy coping strategies, stress-relief techniques and skills to set you up for success. Recovery is a lifelong journey. It’s easier when you’re surrounded by support. Drug rehab prepares you for a life in recovery by guiding your transition after treatment and introducing you to support groups. Whether you’re in recovery or you’re supporting a loved one, support options are available for you. Give us a call (205) 809-8008"
