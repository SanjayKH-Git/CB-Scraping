If you require surgical treatment we seek to provide you complete education of your condition with realistic expectations and out comes.   Our office has the latest technology including diagnostic ultrasound. The diagnostic ultrasound allows us a greater ability to diagnose and treat multiple foot problems the same day, avoiding the need for an MRI which can delay treatment and it is much more cost effective.
