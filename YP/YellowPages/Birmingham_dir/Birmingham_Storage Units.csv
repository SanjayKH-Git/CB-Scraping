ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships. We know that YOU will END UP becoming a customer for life."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships.

Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME.

YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved.

Once all of your personal belongings are packed and loaded, provide your own lock on the roll-down door and you keep the key. PODS will retrieve the container and transport it to your new home or back to a local Storage Center until you are ready for your belongings to be delivered to your new home. PODS offers 24-hour service, it takes just one telephone call for re-delivery of the PODS container and your belongings – across town or across the country."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships. We know that YOU will END UP becoming a customer for life."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships. We know that YOU will END UP becoming a customer for life."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships.

Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME.

YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved.

Once all of your personal belongings are packed and loaded, provide your own lock on the roll-down door and you keep the key. PODS will retrieve the container and transport it to your new home or back to a local Storage Center until you are ready for your belongings to be delivered to your new home. PODS offers 24-hour service, it takes just one telephone call for re-delivery of the PODS container and your belongings – across town or across the country."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships. We know that YOU will END UP becoming a customer for life."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships. We know that YOU will END UP becoming a customer for life."

ONCE YOU Begin asking the right questions. Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME. TRANSPARENT billing practices = we DO NOT charge extra for anything!  
 
 
YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved. What we SAY is what YOU GET! we tend to ASK a FEW more questions from OUR customers because every move requires a different approach. But by getting to know OUR customers and fostering relationships.

Then YOU will quickly SEE HOW we quietly became the oldest and most respected moving team in birmingham and the entire southeast by winning over ONE Family AT a TIME.

YOU won't find ANY surprises on your final bill which sadly has become a standard within OUR industry. OUR quoted hourly rate is exactly what YOU will END UP paying AT the END of your local MOVE. (TOTAL time X hourly rate = final invoice)   
 
 
OUR competitors will tack on ""hidden fees"" disguised AS service charges. Fuel surcharges. Delivery fees. Special handling of high value or heavy item charges. ""PER step"" charges for multilevel houses and apartments and a multitude of other things that we deem unnecessary. Transparency and uniqueness: 
 
 
we disassembled and reassembled ALL Beds and cribs on the DAY of your move. ALL mirrors. Marble tops and glass shelves are removed and carefully wrapped by US on the DAY of your move. YOU'LL find most other moving companies require YOU to USE a THIRD-PARTY Company to crate these items which is more money OUT of your POCKET. ALL appliances are disconnected and reconnected by US on the DAY of your move with a simply release of liability. Again, a large majority of other moving companies will require YOU to utilize a third party to disconnect large appliances (washer. Dryer. Refrigerator). We DO NOT charge extra for pianos. Organs or fine antiques. In fact. Ellis piano in Hoover has been recommending OUR services since 1983 when we saved the DAY for David on a 4TH floor and highly complex grand piano DELIVERY. OUR team trained directly with Steinway & sons and we are the only recommended piano mover by their organization in north & central Alabama. UAB. Samford. Birmingham southern and Montevallo ALL utilize US when needing a piano moved.

We provide packing and unpacking for local moves and/or relocations at an hourly rate.  Because hiring packers can be costly, we provide the choice to sell items our clients no longer want to help put cash back in their pockets. (Items must meet our seller's criteria)  Homes Unlimited also offers junk removal such as appliances, tvs, mattresses, tires, etc.  We also offer Project Specialist services for remodeling, handyman work, etc.Being a people oriented person that thrives on making the lives of others easier and not wanting to help make someone successful anymore, I started offering packing/unpacking services to friends, friends of friends, family and friends of family on a part-time basis.  As the demand started to rise, I made the choice to offer these services (including other services) full-time to the local residents of Birmingham, Al."
