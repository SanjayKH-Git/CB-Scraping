We will explain what is happening to your vision and to your eyes. We try to provide a patient friendly environment. You deserve to be seen at your appointment time, not an hour later. You deserve a friendly, informative eye exam, contact lens fitting and eyeglass selections. Do you have questions about refractive surgery, cataract surgery (and the lens options) or macular degeneration? Do you have questions about your eye insurance or if you have eye insurance. We take the time to answer your questions to the best of our ability. Is something in your eye? Do your eyes itch? Are your eyes dry? We can handle ocular urgencies. It is a beautiful day. Let us help you see it as clearly as you can."
