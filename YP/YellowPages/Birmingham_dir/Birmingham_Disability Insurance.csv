I believe the best way I can provide that service to my clientele is by working as an independent agent with access to over 30 of the most trusted, A+ rated, insurance companies in the industry. This allows me to approach every person as an individual with unique needs and work together to put a plan in place without the bias that comes from being an employee of an insurance company. Don't make the assumption that all insurance companies are essentially the same or charge the same premiums. Picking the right company for you can mean thousands of dollars in savings over the life of the policy or even whether you get insurance at all.
