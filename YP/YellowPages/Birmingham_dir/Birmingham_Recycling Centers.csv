Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business.

Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business. In 2013, longtime and valued associate Steve Crawford became partners with Ed Robinson as co-owner of the company. Today HRH employs a staff of over 25 people, some of whom have over 40 years of service to the company."

Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business. In 2013, longtime and valued associate Steve Crawford became partners with Ed Robinson as co-owner of the company. Today HRH employs a staff of over 25 people, some of whom have over 40 years of service to the company."

Our expansion into global markets has increased as the emphasis on recycling and protecting the environment has become more widespread. Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business. In 2013, longtime and valued associate Steve Crawford became partners with Ed Robinson as co-owner of the company. Today HRH employs a staff of over 25 people, some of whom have over 40 years of service to the company."

Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business. In 2013, longtime and valued associate Steve Crawford became partners with Ed Robinson as co-owner of the company. Today HRH employs a staff of over 25 people, some of whom have over 40 years of service to the company."

Our expansion into global markets has increased as the emphasis on recycling and protecting the environment has become more widespread. Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business. In 2013, longtime and valued associate Steve Crawford became partners with Ed Robinson as co-owner of the company. Today HRH employs a staff of over 25 people, some of whom have over 40 years of service to the company."

Our expansion into global markets has increased as the emphasis on recycling and protecting the environment has become more widespread. Robinson had graduated from Auburn University in 1970, and was about to accept a position with a company in south Alabama when his father asked him if he would lend a hand at the family business for just six months during his grandfather illness. The younger Robinson found that he was perfectly suited for the brokering and marketing end of the business, and he remained there ever since. The third key player, the late Marlin Hinds, joined Hoffman and Robinson and became the other H in HRH Metals. Together, they grew the business from a small neighborhood operation to a major player in the metals processing and recycling business. In 2013, longtime and valued associate Steve Crawford became partners with Ed Robinson as co-owner of the company. Today HRH employs a staff of over 25 people, some of whom have over 40 years of service to the company."
