J. Cochrane in 1959 and incorporated in 1962. Mr. Cochrane had worked as General Manager for Birmingham Furnace and Roofing for many years before deciding to start his own business. With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company. Single-ply, built-up roofing, modified bitumen, and metal roofing are important facets of our work. Our ability to handle multiple roof systems makes us an ideal choice for Owners whose buildings incorporate multiple roof types."

With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company. Single-ply, built-up roofing, modified bitumen, and metal roofing are important facets of our work.

With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company. Single-ply, built-up roofing, modified bitumen, and metal roofing are important facets of our work.

By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company.

By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company.

With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company. Single-ply, built-up roofing, modified bitumen, and metal roofing are important facets of our work.

By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company.

By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company.

With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company.

With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company.

J. Cochrane in 1959 and incorporated in 1962. Mr. Cochrane had worked as General Manager for Birmingham Furnace and Roofing for many years before deciding to start his own business. With his wife as bookkeeper and her brother as sheet metal shop supervisor, he began a business that eventually spanned the Southeast. By the 1970's Cochrane Roofing was handling huge projects throughout the Southeast. We were heavily mechanized and geared towards large projects such as hospitals, colleges, manufacturing plants and shopping malls. We held general contractor's licenses in Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky in addition to our home state. After his death in 1976, J.J. Cochrane's son, W. M. Cochrane took the reins of the Company. A new direction for the Company was laid out and Cochrane Roofing began concentrating on service to Birmingham and it's surrounding areas. In the 1980's we developed a new concept in roofing in Birmingham. Originally intended to handle our own warranty work, our Service Department soon grew to become the primary marketing arm of our Company. There existed a great need for qualified professionals to handle repairs and maintenance issues for businesses and homeowners alike. Today, Cochrane Roofing has a well-earned reputation as a Tile and Slate roofing company. While we find this area of roofing to be challenging and satisfying, we also remain loyal to the systems that built this Company. Single-ply, built-up roofing, modified bitumen, and metal roofing are important facets of our work. Our ability to handle multiple roof systems makes us an ideal choice for Owners whose buildings incorporate multiple roof types."
