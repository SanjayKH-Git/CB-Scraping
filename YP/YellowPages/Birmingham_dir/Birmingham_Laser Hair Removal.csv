Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes.

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."

Comfortable not only in look, but also in feel. We wanted to create an environment that our guests would enjoy, but more importantly one in which our stylists could flourish. With this aim in mind, we set about the task of designing Salon M2. We first opened our doors to the Inverness area on December 6, 2005. One of the first things you'll notice when you enter M2 is the absence of black clothes. We feel that the uniqueness, creativity, and individuality of each member of our staff shouldn't be lost in a sea of black. We use that uniqueness and individuality to create and bring out those very traits that lie within you. We have assembled a staff that is a diverse group, all coming from different backgrounds. We do share one major thing in common ; we love making people feel good about themselves. We specialize in color, foiling, cutting and styling. Corrective color, deep conditioning treatments, and a hair care regimen specifically suited for your needs completes our package. Continuing education in and out of the salon, guest artists, and other instructional tools ensure that we keep abreast of our ever-growing, ever-changing industry. We look forward to welcoming you to Salon M2, our little corner of the world. We offer you creativity, professionalism, value, timeliness, and hospitality."
