In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

Dr. Fixler has always had a passion for compounding to create customized medications tailored for each patients specific needs. In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery. We also offer shipping options and follow strict standards to maintain the integrity of all prescribed contents during transit.Our levels of elite care and service have allowed us to grow. What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service. Our compounding pharmacy has grown to become not only a place for customized care for people but also a place for the same level of care for pets and animals too! We realize pets are another member of the family and we work with veterinarians to extend the same level of compassion and care to all types of animals. Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help! We can customize medications as treats or make a number of other changes to help your pet get the medication they need while you get the peace of mind that your pet is receiving their full dose of medication with less of a struggle.To our current patients and pet owners, we thank you for your loyalty and for being part of our family!

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

Dr. Fixler has always had a passion for compounding to create customized medications tailored for each patients specific needs. In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery. We also offer shipping options and follow strict standards to maintain the integrity of all prescribed contents during transit.Our levels of elite care and service have allowed us to grow. What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service. Our compounding pharmacy has grown to become not only a place for customized care for people but also a place for the same level of care for pets and animals too! We realize pets are another member of the family and we work with veterinarians to extend the same level of compassion and care to all types of animals. Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help! We can customize medications as treats or make a number of other changes to help your pet get the medication they need while you get the peace of mind that your pet is receiving their full dose of medication with less of a struggle.To our current patients and pet owners, we thank you for your loyalty and for being part of our family!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

Physiq Lifestyle Medicine,(205) 874-9940,,https://physiqmedicine.wordpress.com,3125 Independence Dr Suite 300A,Homewood,AL,35209,,,,,['Mo-Fr 08:00-17:00'],,,9 Years,,,,Accredited Business,https://www.yellowpages.com/homewood-al/mip/physiq-lifestyle-medicine-483875776,"On occasion we have heard from an individual NOT completely certain AS to exactly what physiq is or does. That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service. Our compounding pharmacy has grown to become not only a place for customized care for people but also a place for the same level of care for pets and animals too! We realize pets are another member of the family and we work with veterinarians to extend the same level of compassion and care to all types of animals. Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help! We can customize medications as treats or make a number of other changes to help your pet get the medication they need while you get the peace of mind that your pet is receiving their full dose of medication with less of a struggle.To our current patients and pet owners, we thank you for your loyalty and for being part of our family!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."

In 2011 when Inverness Apothecary first opened their doors, Dr. Fixlers vision for specified care and passion for compounding became a reality.Inverness Apothecary believes patients and customers are part of an extended family that deserve a level of attention and care superior to what other large chain pharmacies provide. Our philosophical approach to business is based on three Ps:  Focusing on the care of the Patient while building a relationship with their Physician will ultimately be good for the Pharmacy.This business model is carried out with a retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and compounding pharmacy all within one location. At Inverness Apothecary our pharmacists and certified compounding technicians take part in training and education seminars all over the country. In addition to extensive training, Inverness Apothecarys staff uses the latest technology and techniques available to push the boundaries of compounding possibilities. With this knowledge, experience, and equipment we really can compound just about anything for any patient.The customized patient care Inverness Apothecary is able to provide is also dependent on our level of convenience and accessibility. This is why we offer many ways to make obtaining your prescriptions more convenient which include free local delivery.

What started out as a passion and vision for compounding has grown to so much more. At Inverness Apothecary we continue to grow and add other areas of service.

Often times it isn't easy to get your pet to cooperate taking a medication for treatment. That's where we can help!

That is understandable. It is a somewhat complicated concept and has evolved since the time it was originally dreamed UP. Furthermore. It will continue to evolve. Adapt and GROW. BUT. Here it is: physiq is a comprehensive health & wellness clinic grounded in real medicine and science. OUR mission is advancing and enhancing your overall health & WELLNESS. PHYSIQ focuses on achieving better wellness by helping individuals improve their health. This in particular is WHY we believe that your first step should always BE a consultation with a physician. Whether it BE DR. Fagan or your personal physician, a “wellness” approach aims to prevent sickness and disease. But. In order to DO SO we must work with YOU to overcome ANY existing issues or ILLNESSES. ONCE that is accomplished we CAN move forward with a personalized wellness plan designed to GET YOU feeling. Looking and being healthy & well. OUR methodology for helping YOU achieve and maintain wellness is twofold. The first part is the consultation. And. It goes well beyond what was mentioned above. Physiq will take a thorough look AT your medical history. RUN tests and. In general. GO over YOU with a fine tooth comb to ensure that we have ALL of the information and data NEEDED. AFTER ALL of the necessary information is gathered. Physiq will USE it to help YOU formulate an individualized wellness plan to reach your goals. The primary areas of focus will BE your health. Nutrition and FITNESS. BASED on the data we gather. Your history and your personality physiq CAN guide YOU through the transition into a lifestyle of wellness. The data will give US a much better idea of what YOU need to EAT. HOW much and HOW often. And. Once again. This will BE based on what it is that YOU are hoping to accomplish. We will Also work with YOU to design an exercise & fitness plan that is best suited for YOU. Physiq has the ability to perform tests like VO2 MAX & resting metabolic rate testing in house. We are Also have ONE of only BOD pods available for public USE in the southeast. ALL of these tests give US the information about YOU needed to pinpoint what kind of fitness plan(s) should BE considered. We CAN help YOU find a sweet spot in your activity levels SO that YOU DO NOT over or under train. To SUM it UP: we take a LOT of the guessing game and frustration OUT of your health & wellness efforts. SO. Many GET frustrated by just throwing FAD exercise or FAD diet plans against the Wall…and hoping that ONE sticks. AT physiq. We CAN optimize your efforts SO that YOU CAN finally GET the results that YOU have always wanted. The second part to the physiq approach to wellness is personalized services and solutions to enhance your health & wellness. We CAN provide YOU hormone replacement therapy if YOU are experiencing hormonal imbalances that are causing health issues or hindering your wellbeing. Lipo (lipotropic) injections are available if YOU need a boost in weight loss efforts. And. If there is stubborn FAT that YOU just cannot seem to lose then COOLSCULPTING is an option in-house AT PHYSIQ. OTHER services. Solutions and products are available. But. That should GET YOU started!."
